_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

== Use case
Develop applications that are optimized for a cloud computing architectural model (whether on-prem or in a public cloud). By doing so, they can be developed more quickly, scaled in a flexible way, deliver application-level resiliency,  and provide a consistent and portable environment across disparate infrastructures.


== Background
Some of the key principles of cloud-native application development include:

*Microservices architecture*: Cloud-native applications are often built, in whole or in part, using microservices architecture, which breaks an application down into small, independent services that communicate via. This makes it easier to develop, deploy, and scale applications—and change components of an application with less impact to other parts of the codebase than can be the case with monolithic applications. Microservices communicate with each other through declarative application programming interfaces (APIs).

*Containerization*: Cloud-native applications are typically containerized in an Open Container Initiative (OCI) format container, which can be used to encapsulate microservices and other application components. Containerization is complemented by a wide range of other cloud-native tools, most notably orchestration (typically Kubernetes) but also monitoring, observability, service mesh, security, and other primarily open source projects and products. Additionally, a cloud-native architecture and technologies provide the foundation for newer development models such as serverless computing and Functions-as-a-Service.

*Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)*: Cloud-native applications are developed using CI/CD pipelines, which automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. This helps to ensure that applications are iteratively developed and deployed in a highly-automated manner.

*DevOps*: Cloud-native applications are typically developed using a DevOps approach, an approach to culture, automation, and platform design intended to deliver increased business value and responsiveness through rapid, high-quality service delivery. This is all made possible through fast-paced, iterative IT service delivery. This helps to speed up the application development process and improves the quality of applications.

== The technology


The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes-based container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. Here, it provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, public cloud, and edge deployments. It delivers a complete application platform for both traditional and cloud-native applications, allowing them to run across a variety of infrastructure. It orchestrates the containerized applications and enables agile DevOps development with automated CI/CD workflows. This shortens the lead time for application changes, increases deployment frequency, and lowers the change failure rate. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/ocp-self-managed-trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Quay*] is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images. It analyzes your images for security vulnerabilities, identifying potential issues that can help you mitigate security risks.It can not only store pulls from approved external image registries, but also the built images from the automated CI/CD workflow.
 https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Runtimes*] is a set of products, tools, and components for developing and maintaining cloud-native applications. It offers lightweight runtimes and frameworks for highly distributed cloud architectures, such as Spring Boot and Quarkus. The developer IDE supports development with tooling that connects directly to the platform. Red Hat OpenShift Runtimes is also included as part of Red Hat Application Foundations. 

https://www.redhat.com/en/products/application-foundations?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Application Foundations*]. In addition to Red Hat Runtimes, this product includes additional capabilities for designing, building, deploying, connecting, securing, and scaling cloud-native applications, including foundational patterns like microservices, API-first, and data streaming. When combined with Red Hat OpenShift, Application Foundations creates a hybrid cloud platform for development and operations teams to build and modernize applications efficiently and with attention to security, while balancing developer choice and flexibility with operational control.

Figure 3 is for a simple application with runtimes and integration components. Figure 4 introduces additional business automation components. 
Both are examples of a cloud-native developer working on a stack that includes tooling such as Git and Maven for source code, Docker or Podman for managing containers from the command line, and a collection of integration tooling (such as Process Automation and Integration). 

Initial testing and development happens on the local machine and, once the developer is satisfied, several options are available to start the push of their code to the central development infrastructure; one of several methods as depicted (hooks, plugins, or uploads) to start a CI/CD image build. 

Once it’s built and development testing passed, the image is tagged as a devImage and placed into the image registry. Registry management tooling such as the community project Skopeo then generates a copy for the test infrastructure after CI/CD testing has passed (not shown in detail here); the image is tagged as testImage and copied as shown. All images tagged in this manner can then be deployed in the OpenShift Container Platform test infrastructure for further testing in preparation for being put into production.

=== Development deployments

_Figure 5. Schematic diagram showing the process to take an image from development through testing._

Figure 5 is an example of a cloud native deployment with a developer working on a stack and pushing work to the CI/CD platform using OpenShift client tooling [1]. The CI / CD platform takes the code and initiates a source-to-image workflow [2] building the container image to specification provided in a build configuration. When the build completes, a dev image is tagged and placed into a transient image registry [3] that collects development images. The central enterprise registry is managed by Red Hat Quay, which pulls development images into the enterprise registry as they become available [4] and pushes them out to the development infrastructure image registry (Dev cluster) [5] for further deployment and testing [6].

As testing passes in the development infrastructure using the CI/CD platform, the image is then tagged for testing and pulled into the enterprise registry [7]. All test tagged images are then pushed to the test infrastructure clusters image registry [8] for further deployment and testing [9]. Finally, after testing passes in the CI/ CD platform for testing infrastructure, the image is then tagged for production and pulled into the enterprise registry [10]. All production tagged images are then pushed to the prod infrastructure clusters image registry [11] for further deployment and use [12].


=== Deploying to production

_Figure 6. Schematic diagram showing how images get moved through the process of being pushed to production infrastructure._

Figure 6 illustrates a cloud-native deployment in which a developer is working on a stack and pushing work to the CI/CD platform using their preferred tooling, such as OpenShift client tooling [1]. 

The CI/CD platform takes the code and starts building the container image as specified. When the build completes, a dev image is tagged and placed into a transient image registry [2] that collects development images. The central enterprise registry is managed by Red Hat Quay; it pulls development images into the sandbox registry as they become available [3]. 

Within the sandbox registry, all untrusted and third-party images are collected for testing before exposing them to the organization outside of the development infrastructure. The sandbox development image is then pushed out to the development infrastructure cluster image registry [5] for further deployment and testing [6].

Once tests pass within the development infrastructure using the CI/CD platform—which might, for example, include security checks—the image is then tagged for testing and pulled into the enterprise registry [7]. All test tagged images are then pushed to the test infrastructure clusters image registry [8] for further deployment and testing [9]. Finally, after testing passes in the CI/CD platform for testing infrastructure, the image is then tagged for production and pushed to the production infrastructure cluster image registry [10] for further deployment and use [11].


=== Development and deployment with Python

_Figure 7. Schematic diagram showing cloud-native development and deployment using Python._


Figure 7 shows how, to test applications, an image can be built using OpenShift client tooling in the developer environment [1] from whence it can be deployed [2]. Once the developer is satisfied, they can push changes using Git in the repository where all source code is saved and shared [3]. 

The CI/CD platform then takes the code and initiates a source-to-image workflow once a new tag is created [4], [5], building the container image to the specification provided in a build configuration. When the build completes, an image is tagged and placed into a transient image registry [6] that collects development images. The central enterprise registry is managed by Red Hat Quay; images in the enterprise will have a tag and the Git repository will be updated with newly created tagged images [7]. 

Using a CD platform (e.g. ArgoCD), images can be automatically synced with the test infrastructure registry and deployed [9], [10], [11]. Once the test environment is stable, developers can decide to update the Git repository and add a tag to the image to stage it. The CD platform will automatically sync everything in the cluster. Finally once the application works as expected, it can be moved to production using a similar approach. [9], [10], [11].


== Conclusion

This portfolio architecture has gone through environments and workflows for cloud-native application development at a general level. While individual tool choices may differ, this portfolio architecture is broadly applicable to a wide range of development, testing, and deployment processes in a cloud-native scenario.
Clearly, details will change as we consider more specific scenarios such as AI and ML and we plan to consider narrower cases like these in a future portfolio architectures.
