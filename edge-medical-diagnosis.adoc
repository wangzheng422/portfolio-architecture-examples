_Updated November 2023._

_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all Red Hat architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

== Use cases 

* Accelerating medical diagnosis using condition detection in medical imagery with (artificial intelligence/machine learning) AI/ML in edge computing at medical facilities
* Specific use case of skin cancer detection

== Background 

The current detection process for many types of medical conditions, including skin cancers, involves imaging. For example, photographing suspect or at risk patches of skin is becoming common to be able to check their development over time. 

AI lends itself to being effectively a medical assistant in medical imaging in a variety of ways, including:

* Automating tasks: AI can be used to automate tasks such as image segmentation, which is the process of identifying and isolating different parts of an image. This can free up radiologists to focus on more complex tasks, such as interpreting images.

* Detecting abnormalities: AI can be used to detect abnormalities in medical images that may be invisible to the human eye. This is especially useful for detecting small or subtle changes that can be early signs of disease.

* Personalizing treatment: AI can be used to personalize treatment for patients based on their individual medical imaging data. This can help to ensure that patients receive the most effective treatment possible.

* Providing clinical decision support: AI can be used to provide clinical decision support to radiologists and other healthcare professionals. This can help them to make more informed decisions about patient care.

There are challenges to using AI in this manner such as explainability of results, the use of training data while maintaining confidentiality, and algorithm validation. Nonetheless,  AI has the potential to make a significant impact on medical imaging. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and beneficial applications of AI in this field.



== Solution overview

This architecture, for which Figure 1 provides an overview, covers the use case around Edge Medical Diagnosis in the healthcare industry and drills down on skin cancer detection in particular. The solution provides a way to increase efficiency of a medical facility by reducing time spent on routine diagnosis and medical diagnosis of disease. This gives  medical experts more time to focus on the difficult cases.

_Figure 3. Network-centric schematic view of Edge Medical Diagnosis architecture._

The solution shown in Figure 3 has two distinct locations: the diagnostic facility where the medical staff and
the edge x-ray devices are located and the medical data center where development and monitoring of the solution takes
place.

Initial images are sent into the diagnostic facility image receiver and an event is registered to start the processing
for automated diagnosis. These images are stored locally, anonymized, and automatically evaluated for possible
disease detection. A notification is generated for the medical staff, whether automated detection, non-detection, or
an edge case requiring qualified medical staff review. (In many cases, medical staff will want to give at least a quick review of detection and non-detection cases as well.)

In the process of image capture and processing, the images are sent back to the medical data center to be added
to the collection used for model training and development. The applications, machine learning models, data science
development, and dashboards for monitoring the processes are all in constant evolution. Developers and operations
teams maintain code and infrastructure manifests for full GitOps deployment of the architectural elements.

=== Edge Medical Diagnosis with GitOps

_Figure 4. Schematic view of Edge Medical Diagnosis architecture with a focus on GitOps delivery and deployment._

GitOps delivery and development are essential to a fully automated cloud hosted solution. Figure 4 features the elements focusing only on development and deployment of the Edge Medical Diagnosis elements needed for this solution. It does not show the patient-facing medical staff and the edge image capturing; rather it features developer and IT operations staff on the back end.

In the medical data center, developers deliver code projects into the CI/CD pipelines and trigger eventual container image builds that are placed into the registry. The same thing happens on the IT operations side, where system configuration and
manifest code is maintained in their repository.

The developer image registry is replicated out to the image registry in the remote diagnostic facility and the source code repository for IT operations is also replicated out to the remote location. These both are setup to
trigger the GitOps pipelines to sync updates to the image registry and the operation's source code repository to the OpenShift platform. This means it's deploying, configuring, and applying manifests to the applications and services
used to process the medical diagnosis imaging solution.

=== Skin Cancer Detection use case

Figure 5 shows a Skin Cancer Detection use case that includes IBM data science and storage components.

_Figure 5. Schematic view of Skin Cancer Detection architecture that includes IBM data science and storage components._

The schematic in Figure 5 focuses on the datacenter side of the system. This specific focus is needed since the images can be acquired in different ways from the various devices that can be used to acquire such images. In case those devices are connecting to smartphones or tables, an application can be installed on those devices. If those devices communicate with a computer, it can host such an application.

The chosen device connected to the image acquirer tool transfers the images to the Image Upload Application. The Image Upload Application saves the image metadata in a database; the image itself is saved in an object storage provided by IBM Storage Ceph. The database is backed by IBM Storage Ceph block storage. Additionally, the Image Upload Application will also place a message into AMQ to ensure the image will be processed.

IBM Watson watches the AMQ (Kafka) incoming-images queue and processes incoming images; it returns the result to the doctor via the notification service.

The doctors' diagnoses based on the images and the results of biopsies, where available, can be used to retrain the AI/ML model periodically to improve the accuracy and the precision of the model. The applications, machine learning models, data science development, and dashboards for monitoring the processes are all in constant evolution. Developers and operation teams maintain code and infrastructure manifests for full GitOps deployment of the architectural elements. The installation and management of all components in the environment is done with automation using Ansible, which helps create a predictable and auditable enviornment.
