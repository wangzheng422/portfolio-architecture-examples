== Use case

Disasters that affect companies can take many forms: public health, terrorism and war, and extreme weather. They can also affect companies in different ways from needing to shut down offices, help affected employees, and regain access to networks and computers. This portfolio architecture focuses on anticipating and responding to supply chain challenges due to natural disasters such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and droughts but the overall architecture and principles apply to a wide range of disaster planning scenarios.

== Background

Events could result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in  warehouses.

In 2020, there were https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2020-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters-historical[22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters] in the US alone. and you can understand why modeling the risk from weather is so critical to your operations.  It’s easy to see why modeling the risk from weather is so critical to supply chain and store operations. At the same time, according to the https://www.thebci.org/[Business Continuity Institute], 72% of suppliers who dealt with a breakdown in their supply chain lacked the full, real-time visibility needed to come up with a fast and simple solution.

=== Business Problem
There are a wide range of possible supply chain effects. Events could result in physical damage to properties; limitations on store operating hours; the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities; the temporary lack of an adequate workforce; disruptions to our IT systems; the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers; the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas; delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots; and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in warehouses.

A central metric is time to recover (TTR), the time it would take for a particular node—a supplier facility, a distribution center, or a transportation hub—to be restored to full functionality after a disruption.

The second metric is risk exposure, an assessment of exposure to risk based on a model that applies suppliers' TTR to estimate the performance impact, including operational (lost production) and financial (lost revenue and profit).



== Background

Business need to anticipate and respond to supply chain challenges due to unanticipated disasters.

According to the https://www.thebci.org/[Business Continuity Institute], 72% of suppliers who dealt with a breakdown in their supply chain lacked the full, real-time visibility needed to come up with a fast and simple solution.

=== Metrics

A central feature is time to recover (TTR), the time it would take for a particular node — a supplier facility, a distribution center, or a transportation hub — to be restored to full functionality after a disruption.

The second concept is risk exposure, an assessment of exposure to risk based on a model that applies suppliers’ TTR to estimate the performance impact, including operational (lost production) and financial (lost revenue and profit).

=== How to prepare

Later in this portfolio architecture, we’ll take you through a detailed technical architecture that can help you deal with weather disruption preparation. We’ll also consider the scenario where a store is open but disconnected from a company’s datacenter.

However, first, let’s first consider at a high level on how companies can prepare their supply chains for weather-related disasters:

*Identify potential risks.* The first step is to identify the potential weather risks that could disrupt your supply chain. Depending upon where a company and its primary suppliers is located, the risks may vary—though keep in mind that upstream supply chain effects of a disruption may be far removed from your region.

*Assess your vulnerabilities.* Once you have identified the potential risks, you need to assess your vulnerabilities. This means understanding how a disruption could impact your supply chain and what steps you can take to mitigate the impact. This includes making a list of your most critical suppliers, those that provide you with the most important products or services. Consider your suppliers' locations, their track record with weather-related disruptions, and their disaster preparedness plans.

*Develop a plan.* Once you have assessed your vulnerabilities, you need to develop a plan to mitigate the impact of a disruption. This plan should include steps to identify and communicate with suppliers, to develop alternative sources of supply, and to have contingency plans in place for different scenarios. You should also plan for rerouting shipments, communicating with customers, and managing inventory. All stages of the supply chain are part of the plan.

*Test your plan.* Like any backup or contingency plan, it is important to test your plan and recheck its inputs and assumptions regularly to make sure that it is up-to-date and that it works as intended. This will help you to identify any gaps in your plan and to make necessary adjustments.

== Architecture

Figures 3 and 4 show the interaction of customer systems with supply chain optimization platform systems in the context of a retail scenario with branch stores. We consider both preparation for weather disruption and the workflows associated with an operating store that becomes disconnected from the datacenter. As noted earlier, while we chose to show the example of an extreme weather event specifically, the overall architecture applies to disaster preparedness more generally.

=== Weather disruption preparation

image:https://gitlab.com/osspa/portfolio-architecture-examples/-/raw/main/images/schematic-diagrams/disasterreadiness-sd.png[alt="disaster readiness and response", width=700]

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram of weather disruption preparation use case._

Preparation starts with external data feeds, such as IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, anticipating disruptive environmental conditions.The Demand Intelligence system is then alerted to the potential disruption.

Inventory Analysis anticipates potential low stock levels and predicts demand levels. Control Tower collects current inventory positions from stores, in-transit, and warehouses plus future inventory positions and then alerts Colleague (a human in the loop) with a set of work queues to mitigate the disruption. Colleague takes remediation action by selecting actions provided by Control Tower.

Control Tower triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including:

* Ordering more stock in nearby and affected areas
* Adjusting stock positions within the existing Supply Chain
* Planning transport around the affected area
* Coordinating with suppliers and vendors to position inventory


=== Disconnected store

The following scenario shows how data can be transmitted from a store to the datacenter as part of an overall solution to setting up and maintaining the computer facilities in a store or branch office.

image:https://gitlab.com/osspa/portfolio-architecture-examples/-/raw/main/images/schematic-diagrams/disconnectedstore-sd.png[alt="disconnected store", width=700]

_Figure 4. Schematic diagram of disaster response with a disconnected store use case._

When the store is disconnected, point of sale devices send information to in-store servers that collect transactions. Then, once the connection is restored, the store server queues the events and plays them back.

The transaction events are now read and Business Automation workflows are triggered to update corporate systems. Data is updated through Business Automation to:

* Adjust stock position data for the affected stores
* Update replenishment system
* Setup store operations data
* Consolidate data to update the work queue in the Supply Chain Control Tower

== Summary

Extreme weather events and other types of disasters can overtake a company and its supply chain quickly. The statistical likelihood of certain types of events, such as blizzards, in a given area, may make them seem routine but they can snarl supply chains nonetheless. Nor can the company ignore the possibility of major weather events such as hurricanes just because they’re rare. Planning is essential, together with your suppliers in all cases—as is constantly updating your assumptions and the list of partners you’ll need to work with.


== Action Guide

From a high-level perspective, the *Action Guide* represents a future state for organizations considering a comprehensive commitment. The idea is to outline a set steps that can be prioritized to reach that future state by adding new functionality to your existing systems.

* Automation
* Sustainability
* Modernization
