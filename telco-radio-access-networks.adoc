5G is the latest evolution of wireless mobile technology. It can deliver a number of services from the network edge:

* Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)
** 5G enhances data speeds and experiences with new radio capabilities like mmWave frequency spectrum for higher
bandwidth allocation and theoretical throughput up to 20Gbps.
* Ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (uRLLC)
** 5G supports vertical industry requirements, including sub-millisecond latency with
less than 1 lost packet in 105 packets.
* Massive machine type communications (mMTC)
** 5G supports cost-efficient and robust connection for up to 1 million mMTC, NB-IOT, and LTE-M devices per square
kilometer without network overloading.

*Use case:* The digital transformation of mobile networks  is accelerating and cloudification is increasing. Following
the core network, radio access network (RAN) solutions are now taking advantage of the benefits of cloud computing.

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. It
provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat AMQ Streams* is a massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on
the Apache Kafka project. It offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share
data with high throughput and low latency.

** *Red Hat Smart Management* combines the flexible and powerful infrastructure management capabilities with the
ability to execute remediation plans. It helps you more securely manage any environment supported by Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, from physical machines to hybrid multiclouds.

** *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management* for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with
built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and
enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale.

** *Red Hat Quay* is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images. It analyzes your
images for security vulnerabilities, identifying potential issues that can help you mitigate security risks.

** *Red Hat Identity Management* provides a centralized and unified way to manage identity stores, authentication,
policies, and authorization policies in a Linux-based domain.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

This architecture supports the following Open Radio Access Network deployment scenarios such as decentralized, where
the Distributed Units are located at the cell site and centralized, where the Distributed Units are located at the edge
site and Central Units located at the regional data center.
