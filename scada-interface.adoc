_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Provide interfaces with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that are compliant with North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) regulations using different layers of API gateways to protect business service across network zones.

*Background:* SCADA systems are used extensively in many verticals, including utility companies. SCADA devices have gone through several generations. Historically, these control systems were mostly “dumb” in that they mostly took actions in response to pre-programmed triggers and heuristics. For example, predictive maintenance commonly took place based on either a set length of time or the number of hours it was in service.

SCADA systems also historically mostly functioned independently of the company’s information technology (IT) systems. Companies increasingly see the benefit of bridging these operational technology (OT) systems with their IT. Factory systems can be much more flexible as a result. They can also benefit from newer technologies such as AI/ML, thereby allowing for tasks like maintenance to be scheduled based on multiple real-time measurements rather than simple programmed triggers while bringing processing power closer to data.


== Solution overview
This portfolio architecture focuses on energy providers in North America that need to be compliant with NERC regulations. In order to achieve this, they will typically want to modernize the interfaces between their business applications and their SCADA systems. Doing so also allows them to make better use of collected information by analyzing it with AI/ML and decision management tools to better address customer needs.


====
As shown in Figure 1, SCADA interface modernisation provides the following:

. Modernize access to critical network equipments and SCADA systems
. Compliance to relevant international industry standards
. Improve business agility by standardizing access to old and/or heterogeneous systems using messaging and APIs

== The technology
The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, public cloud, and edge deployments. It delivers a complete application platform for both traditional and cloud-native applications, allowing them to run anywhere. In this solution, Red Hat OpenShift provides the platform on which the applications running in the electric/OT zone retrieve data from the SCADA devices and the business apps that are in the enterprise/IT zone run. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/ocp-self-managed-trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/products/integration?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Integration*], also sold as Red Hat Application Foundations, includes Red Hat AMQ which enables the applications in the two separated network zones to communicate using AMQ message queues and brokers. It is deployed on top of Red Hat OpenShift.


https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] provides an enterprise framework for building and operating IT automation at scale across hybrid clouds including edge deployments. It enables users across an organization to create, share, and manage automation—from development and operations to security and network teams. Among other functions in this solution, it automates the compliance of the OpenShift clusters with defined security policies. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux*] is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s the open source operating system foundation on which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal, virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/server/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

_Figure 6. Schematic diagram overview._


As shown in Figure 6, there are two segregated networks, one where the SCADA devices and the applications that talk to them reside (NERC/electric/OT zone) and another one where the business applications run (enterprise/internal/IT zone).

_Figure 7. Schematic diagram of IT zone._

As seen in Figure 7, the Red Hat OpenShift cluster deployed in the internal IT zone hosts the business applications that consume data from the applications in the OT zone, mainly for analytics use.

_Figures 9, 10, and 11. Schematic diagrams of the SCADA interfaces data architecture overall, in the OT network, and in the IT network correspondingly._

As shown in Figures 9, 10, and 11, the Red Hat OpenShift clusters in both networks have a replica of the AMQ message queue which they use a message broker to manage. When the business applications need to request data from the SCADA devices, they create a message in the AMQ queue in the IT zone that is replicated in the queue in the OT zone. That message is read by the appropriate application which will then retrieve the needed data from the relevant SCADA device.  It’s now placed in the AMQ queue and replicated back to the queue in the IT zone and finally read by the business application that originated the request.
