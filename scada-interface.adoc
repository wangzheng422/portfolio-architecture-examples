This Portfolio Architecture targets energy providers in North America that need to be compliant with NERC regulations
and in order to achieve this they decide to modernize the interfaces between their business applications and their
SCADA systems also for a better consumption of information that can be used in combination with AI/ML and decision
management tools to better address customer needs.

====
*SCADA interface modernisation*
. Modernize access to critical network equipments and SCADA systems
. Compliance to relevant international industry standards
. Enablement of business agility by standardizing access to old and/or heterogeneous systems using messaging and APIs
====

*Use case:* Provide interfaces with SCADA systems that are compliant with NERC regulations, creating different layers
of API gateways to protect business service depending on the network zones.

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
** *Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform* is a foundation for building and operating automation across an organization.
The platform includes all the tools needed to implement enterprise-wide automation.

** *Red Hat Smart Management* combines the flexible and powerful infrastructure management capabilities with the
ability to execute remediation plans. It helps you more securely manage any environment supported by Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, from physical machines to hybrid multiclouds.

** *Red Hat Satellite* is an infrastructure management product specifically designed to keep Red Hat Enterprise Linux
environments and other Red Hat infrastructure running efficiently, with security, and compliant with various standards.

** *Red Hat Integration* is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and
data across hybrid infrastructures.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions* is combining an intelligent operating system with predictive management
tools and SAP-specific content, Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions provides a single, consistent, highly
available foundation for business-critical SAP and non-SAP workloads.
