Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Real-time inventory management is an automated process of recording sales and purchases through the use
of software. It gives you a complete picture of what's happening with inventory, allowing your business to react
quickly to supply chain needs.

====
*Real-Time Stock Control*

. Maintain accurate stock levels across all channels
. Real-time stock inventory visible to customers, business and 3rd parties
. Avoid under or over stocking
====

*Use case:* Providing (near) real-time stock positions and dynamic pricing promotions information to retailer
omnichannels.

Stock control changes are needed anytime interactions happen with customers, store associates, vendors, suppliers, and partners. Customers purchase stock, triggering changes to be made to the inventory lists. Vendors deliver shipments to warehouses that require updating and processing of orders both in the warehouse inventory and to notify store of the stock availability. Just a few examples of this architecture in action. The update or change request comes into the API management and is processed by the available to sell services which trigger events. The event streams can kick off
long running processes that can, over time, require input from the external sources. The promotions and payments services both are used to update their respective activities; a sale of an item of stock, or the inclusion of a promotion on an item of stock.

The vendors, suppliers, and partners are shown with access to integration services that modify catalog management systems, logistics systems, supply chain systems, and order management systems that can be anywhere external to the organization.
