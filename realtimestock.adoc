Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied
where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a
small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele.

*Use case:* Providing (near) real-time stock positions and dynamic pricing promotions information to retailer
omnichannels.

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat Integration* is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and
data across hybrid infrastructures.

** *Red Hat AMQ Streams* is a massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on
the Apache Kafka project. It offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share
data with high throughput and low latency.

** *Red Hat 3scale API Management* makes it easy to manage your APIs. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize
your APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

Stock control changes are needed anytime interactions happen with customers, store associates, vendors, suppliers, and
partners. Customer purchase stock, triggering changes to be made to the inventory lists. Vendors delivery shipments
to warehouses that require updating and processing of orders both in the warehouse inventory and to notify store of the
stock availability. Just a few examples of this architecture in action. The update or change request comes into the
API management and is processed by the available to sell services which trigger events. The event streams can kick off
long running processes that can, over time, require input from the external sources. The promotions and payments
services both are used to update their respective activities; a sale of an item of stock, or the inclusion of a
promotion on an item of stock.

The vendors, suppliers, and partners are shown with access to integration services that modify catalog management
systems, logistics systems, supply chain systems, and order management systems that can be anywhere external to the
organisation. Integration data services provide connections to the
