_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Supporting the doctor's decision on skin cancer diagnosis with medical imagery with AI/ML.

*Background:* Every year, millions of skin cancer get detected.
The current detection process for skin cancers is based on a visual check from a doctor.
In the last decade, photographing suspect or at risk patches of skin is becoming common to be able to check their development over time.
Those images need to be conserved in a way that guarantees high degrees of confidentiality due to the nature of the content and availability to ensure usefulness.

== Solution overview

This architecture covers the use case around Skin Cancer Detection in the healthcare industry. The solution provides a way to enhance the doctor ability to identify skin cancer by analysing skin patches images to offer the doctor a synthetic second opinion. This allows to increase efficiency and precision of the diagnosis.

*Why Skin Cancer Detection?*

. Provide expert-assist to medical experts to reduce time spent on routine diagnosis
. Need for faster medical diagnosis of skin cancers
. Focus medical expert time on most difficult to interpret cases

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] Kubernetes container platform with both Serverless and GitOps mentioned above. It provides a consistent application platform to manage supports for full automated workflow and flexible, scalable resource usage.

https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/amq-streams-datasheet?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat AMQ Streams*] is a data streaming platform with high throughput and low latency. Streams images and registration events to corresponding microservices to automated diagnosis.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] automates the deployment and the management of the infrastructure and the applications running on it.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift GitOps*] ensure all workloads manifests are versioned, pick up changes from code repository into the CI/CD pipelines and trigger image build and deploys into clouds.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux*] is the world’s leading Enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system (OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal, virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

https://www.ibm.com/products/ceph[*IBM Storage Ceph*] is a software-defined storage solution for block storage, file storage, and object storage used for images, continuous deployment models, analytics, AI/ML datasets and models.

https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio[*IBM Watson Studio*] develops, trains, and tests for AI/ML modeling and visualization in sandbox environment. Diagnosis models are being continuously trained and updated, this streamline workflow allows a more rapid, agile application lifecycle.

This is an overview look at the Skin Cancer Detection architecture, providing the solution details and the elements described above in both a network and data centric view.

The solution focuses on the datacenter side of the system.
This specific focus is needed since the images can be acquired in different ways from the various devices that can be used to acquire such images.
In case those devices are connecting to smartphones or tables, an application can be put on those devices.
In case those devices communicate with a computer, this can host such an application.

The chosen device connected to the image acquirer tool transfer the images to the Image Upload Application.
The Image Upload Application will save the meta-data regarding the image to a Database, while the image is saved on an object storage provided by IBM Storage Ceph.
The database is backed by IBM Storage Ceph block storage.
Additionally, the Image Upload Application will put into AMQ Streams a message to ensure the image will be processed.

IBM Watson watches the Kafka incoming-images queue and processes incoming images returning the result to the doctor via the notification service.

Leveraging the archived images, the doctors diagnoses and the results of biopsies, where available, the AI/ML model can be re-trained periodically to improve the accuracy and the precision of the model.
The applications, machine learning models, data science development and dashboards for monitoring the processes are all in constant evolution.
Developers and operations teams are maintaining code and infrastructure manifests for full GitOps deployment of the architectural elements.
The installation and management of all components in the environment is performed through automation, allowing to create a predictable and auditable enviornment.
