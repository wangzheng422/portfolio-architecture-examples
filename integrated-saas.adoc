== Use case 

Integrating with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, platforms, and services empowers organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.


== Background

Integrating with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications is the process of operationally connecting SaaS solutions to other separate computer systems or applications into a single larger system, allowing the solutions to functionally work together.

Many organizations subscribe to SaaS applications to meet both customer-facing and internal needs. SaaS can offer a quick answer to many organizational requirements, whether out-of-the box or by taking advantage of the many customizations and partner add-ons that many SaaS vendors offer.

However, while some SaaS applications can be useful as turnkey standalone solutions, in larger organizations with more complex application environments, silos are often undesirable. For example, SaaS applications often store data in their own databases, which can make it difficult to integrate with other data sources. By integrating SaaS with other compute infrastructure, you can create a single, unified view of your data. This can make it easier to analyze data, make better decisions, and automate tasks.

Many organizations also want to maintain some of their infrastructure on-prem—whether for cost, data sovereignty, perceived security or other reasons. 

For example, a financial institution might use SaaS for its trading platform, but keep its risk management system on-prem. This allows the institution to take advantage of the low latency and high availability of the cloud for its trading platform, while maintaining direct control over its risk data.

If you are considering integrating SaaS with other compute infrastructure, there are a few things you need to keep in mind:

* You need to have a clear understanding of your business needs and requirements.
* You need to choose the right SaaS applications and compute infrastructure.
* You need to implement a security plan that protects your data.
* You need to monitor your integrated environment to ensure that it is performing as expected.

By carefully planning and implementing an integrated SaaS solution, you can reap the benefits of both SaaS and other compute infrastructure.



== Solution overview

Figure 1 provides an overview of the SaaS applications integration solution. This solution enables managing updates to SaaS applications back into associated processes as well as the integration of other components of the compute environment with SaaS applications and platforms.

The container platform in this solution as shown is on-prem but it could also be hosted at a cloud provider.
