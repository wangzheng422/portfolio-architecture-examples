Modern application infrastructure has become more complex as it has become more powerful and easy to
consume. Keeping infrastructure safe and compliant is a challenge for many organizations. One of the most powerful
approaches to infrastructure management today is the combination of using historical data-driven insights and
automation tools for applying remediation across a scaling estate of hosts in a targeted and prioritized manner.

*Use case:* Managing security, policy and patches for a large number of servers in data centers or public/private clouds.

*Data Center or Public Cloud*::

*Smart Management* Securely manage any environment supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

*Ansible* is used for adding a powerful layer of automation to a customer's environment, and can be leveraged as
another means of distributing remediation throughout an estate.

*Red Hat Hybrid Cloud*::

*Red Hat Insights* services each perform their individual functions, and the customer can choose which services fit their specific needs. For example, Compliance will assess a systems status against a set of compliance rules, and Vulnerability assesses any security risks that may be currently active in the environment.

1. Client hosts register to Satellite which initially collects RHEL system data for Red Hat Insights.
2. Smart Management and Ansible Automation Platform secure connections to the Hybrid Cloud Console.
3. Anonymized data is analyzed by Red Hat:
Insights services analyze data against known issues as well as customer defined parameters.
Insights for RHEL generate remediation plans and configures playbooks to return to the Smart Management platform.
Insights for Ansible generates remediation to return to the automation controller.
4. Remediation assets download to Satellite from Red Hat hosted Insights, on-demand.
5. RHEL remediation is delivered to the client systems.
Ansible runner automates running the remediation playbooks on multiple systems at once, and anything requiring manual
configuration is outlined in the remediation plan in the Satellite.
Any package updates are pulled from Red Hat Satellite. Remediation status is outlined in the dashboard in the Satellite.
6. Ansible Syncs with Red Hat
Ansible remediation is delivered to Ansible Automation Platform
RHEL remediation plans can also be manually synced to the automation controller (optional).
7. Ansible’s automation controller can be used to deliver the additional remediation synced (optional) in tandem with
it’s normal automation workflow.

The data path, starting from the hosts, delives to the Satellite. Here, both the automation controller and satellite
transmits the anonymized data to Red Hat where the cloud services internally analyze what issues might be present,
what solutions are available, and what remediation plan we have to move forward with.

From there, these remediation plans, and any associated playbooks, are passed back to the customer's environment, where
the satellite will orchestrate the application of which issues have automated solutions, as well as what package updates
will be delivered to any applicable Red Hat Enterprise Linux system, and the automation controller will apply any
remediation to Ansible Automation Platform.
