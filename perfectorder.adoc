== Use cases

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Use case |Problem statement |Solution
|Stock on hand |*Inventory visibility* answers questions such as: What goods are in stock, how much
do you have, and where are the items? All that information is required to
fill orders. |An Inventory management system helps provide that
information and more.

|Forecasting for fulfillment / Demand forecasting |*Forecasting* predicts how much inventory you’ll need on hand to meet
upcoming demand. |The goal of forecasting is to have just enough inventory
on hand to cover predicted sales for a prescribed period of time.

|Optimal inventory |*Monitoring Orders & Inventory* minimizes lost
sales, misplaced stock, and excess ordering, thereby boosting
 profits. |Optimal inventory level is
the ideal quantity of product that one should have in a fulfillment
center(s) at any given time. By optimizing inventory levels, you reduce
the risk of common inventory issues, from high storage costs to
out-of-stock items.

|Warehouse location |*Inside the Warehouse* refers to the specific spot,
such as a shelf or a bin, where a product is located within the four
walls of a warehouse. It impacts the efficiency and timeliness of
picking products. |The products most often picked are placed in the most
efficient spot. As products change and demand for products changes, the
inventory layout can be updated to ensure continued efficiency.

== Background

Within inventory management, perfect order refers to the ability to deliver the correct product to the customer, in the right quantity, at the right time, in the right condition, with the right documentation, and at the right cost. Essentially, it means meeting customer demand without errors or delays to the degree possible. Inventory management encompasses procedures and processes that directly or indirectly affect the bottom line ordering, receiving, storing, tracking, and accounting for all of the goods a business sells. It is a key element of supply chain management and is critical to any business that sells physical goods or is responsible for maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) supplies.

To achieve perfect order, a company must have an efficient inventory management system that optimizes inventory levels, tracks inventory movement, and ensures accurate order fulfillment. This involves balancing the cost of carrying inventory with the cost of stockouts and lost sales, as well as implementing processes and technologies that enable real-time inventory visibility and accurate demand forecasting.

Achieving perfect order can help businesses reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, increase sales, and maintain a competitive advantage.


=== Business problem

Multi-channel order fulfillment operations typically have inventory spread across many places throughout the supply chain. Therefore, you need to have visibility into what inventory you have and where it’s located. Businesses need an accurate view of inventory to guarantee fulfillment of customer orders, reduce shipment turnaround times, and minimize stockouts and markdowns. Furthermore, inventory may not be on-hand or may be in a different location than expected. 

Managing customer orders is also not a binary can ship or can’t ship situation. Breaking shipments into multiple parts or making partial shipments may address many customer needs even if an order can't be shipped in full.

Spreadsheets, hand-counted stock levels, and manual order placement have largely been replaced by advanced inventory tracking software. An inventory management system can simplify the process of ordering, storing, and using inventory by automating end-to-end production, business management, demand forecasting, and accounting. 

This portfolio architecture describes and illustrates such a solution. It has many benefits:
* Provides significant insights into how supply chain performance can be improved by anticipating anomalies in logistics costs and performance before they occur and delivers insights into where automation can deliver significant scale advantages
* Reduces out-of-stock occurrences
* Optimizes inventory costs by balancing inventory with operational demand
* Improves stock allocation to improve space utilization
* Reduces dormant and slow-moving inventory
* Delivers an accurate assessment of critical spares and the money invested in those parts
* Increases transparency into and visibility of critical and non-critical spares inventory for the organization
* Reduces time spent looking for and ordering parts
* Accelerates disposal of obsolete materials
* Returns can potentially be refurbished to create a revenue stream
by re-circulation, refurbishment, or repairs - thereby reducing disposal and
recycling costs

== Architecture

Figure 3 shows the inventory management scenario, with steps and data flows, both for a
perfect order case and when the order is not perfect.

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram illustrating perfect order._

The basic workflow is as follows.

The customer places or otherwise interacts with an order through the omni-channel. Omni-channel refers to the integration of all channels and touchpoints that a retailer uses to interact with its customers, whether it is in-store, online, through mobile devices, social media, or any other means. The goal of omni-channel retailing is to create a seamless and consistent customer experience across all channels, allowing customers to shop and interact with a retailer using the channel that is most convenient for them at any given time. Omni-channel retailing requires retailers to have a sophisticated technology infrastructure that enables real-time inventory visibility, order fulfillment, and customer data management across all channels.

After the order is placed, inventory fulfillment and delivery tracking information is quickly obtained from the Supply Assurance Platform with the backend system accessed via API Management and other backend systems accessed via the Integration Services. The Inventory Management System checks to see if the inventory is available; if it is, the items are locked and the inventory updated.

The Store Operations System then determines if the store can fulfill the order. If the Store can only fulfill a partial order, it notifies the customer to determine if partial order fulfillment is acceptable. If acceptable, package the order and get it ready for delivery to the customer—then notify the Transport/Logistics System to schedule delivery.

If a partial order is not acceptable, use the Warehouse Management System to find which warehouse can fulfill remaining order items. Send an alert to the warehouse to combine partial orders and package items and get it ready for delivery. Notify customers and update/sync related systems, including the Transport/Logistics System.

In either case, cross-check with the Fulfillment System to schedule and track the order in real-time and notify the customer. Provide proof of delivery (electronic or paper) to the customer.

== Action guide

From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital supply chain in the areas of:

* Automation
* Sustainability
* Modernization

For more details on this approach, see The Action Guide details in https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/1BYY6VEM[Own your transformation] survey of 1500 CSCOs across 24 industries. It covers actionable steps in several areas of automation, sustainability, as well as the modernization to hybrid cloud platforms.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
| |Actionable Step |Implementation details
|Automation |Monitor the criticality of inventory items to the
organization |Some are critical to operations or employee safety. Others
are ``nice to have'' but not urgent. Select a methodology and a solution
that routinely audit those parameters. For example, any time a new
transaction is created in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), the
solution needs to apply that transaction against the material to
determine if the criticality is still correct.

|Automation |Accelerate automation in extended workflows |Automate the
response using workflows that are consistant with criticality of the
inventory items.

|Automation |Provide visibility into the inventory system |When users
are inspecting inventory items, users can see where they have available
inventory and receive recommendations about how much inventory can and
should be transferred to the out-of-stock (OOS) or approaching out-of-stock (AOOS) locations. These recommendations
are based on adding automation and AI to make workflows smarter.

|Automation |Automate the maintenance of scores to each individual item
|Eliminate data manual entry for criticality with a systems wide
approach.

|Sustainability |Includes sustainability metrics into decision making
|Surface sustainability information as part of the inventory management
processes.

|Modernization |Modernization for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid
cloud platforms |The decision for a future, Kubernetes-based enterprise
platform is defining the standards for development, deployment and
operations tools and processes for years to come and thus represents a
foundational decision point.
