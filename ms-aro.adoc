= Solution summary

This architecture covers Azure OpenShift Implementation.

*Use case:* Adopt cloud native development technologies and mindset using a container platform without having to manage it and controlling its costs and use all the services offered by cloud providers to create more innovative and useful applications

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions* is combining an intelligent operating system with predictive management
tools and SAP-specific content, Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions provides a single, consistent, highly
available foundation for business-critical SAP and non-SAP workloads.

** *Red Hat Openshift* is a Kubernetes container platform for orchestrating, managing, handling deployments, auto scaling of
the containerized application. It provides the foundation for Red Hat Integration which has the components needed to communicate SAP and non-SAP workloads, apart from being the platform on which new cloud native applications that talk to the SAP core can be developed. In this PA Red Hat Openshift also provides a PostgreSQL DB that is used to cache data from SAP that will be used by BI applications for reporting.

** *Red Hat Integration* is a set of integration and messaging technologies in the form of containerized and API-centric solution. It runs on Red Hat Openshift and among the many integration components it has some specific to SAP. *Red Hat Fuse* is one of its elements. It uses Camel, namely its SAP Netweaver component, to allow SAP and non-SAP applications to connect to SAP Netweaver based instances (classic Netweaver or SAP S/4HANA) using RFC, iDoc and OData protocols by means of which function modules and BAPIs (Business APIs) can be triggered in the SAP core and also data structures can be accessed directly. All this is achieved by creating and exposing API endpoints. *Red Hat 3Scale* is another component of Red Hat Integration used in this PA to manage the access of the satellite systems and applications to the APIs exposed by Red Hat Fuse.
