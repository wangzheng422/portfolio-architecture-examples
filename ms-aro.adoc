_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Modernize the way applications are deployed and run, using microservices and serverless technologies while prioritizing security. Adopt a DevOps philosophy without the need to maintain the underlying infrastructure or the platform for the applications.

*Background:* More and more organizations are adopting cloud-native development technologies together with DevOps processes and culture. But maintaining an in-house container platform to do so requires a large up-front investment in infrastructure and a specialized team of administrators often referred to as site reliability engineers (SRE) on an ongoing basis. Both constitute a significant overhead and can present a barrier to adopting container platforms.

Many organizations are finding that running a supported open source container platform like Red Hat OpenShift on a public cloud synch as Microsoft Azure can eliminate much of the operational burden associated with the underlying container infrastructureâ€”allowing them to focus on their differentiating cloud-native applications. At the same time, by deploying a container platform that is available on multiple cloud providers as well as on-prem, they retain the flexibility to move workloads across providers as their needs change.





== Solution overview

The Azure Red Hat OpenShift Implementation architecture tackles the challenge of running many redundant platforms. Instead, all applications can be developed and run on a single platform. 

The primary goals of the Azure Red Hat OpenShift implementation are as follows:

====
*Azure Red Hat OpenShift implementation*

. Enable the adoption of a cloud-native solution to migrate applications to and build new ones on and enable a hybrid cloud model
. Make the most of all the services offered by Azure when developing applications by integrating them with the container platform
. Reduce the cost of having a permanent dedicated on-premise infrastructure for the container platform as well as the cost and need for skills to manage it

== Logical diagram

As seen in Figure 2, the Azure Red Hat OpenShift solution uses a combination of Red Hat OpenShift functionality and cloud-native services from the Microsoft Azure platform.

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/azure[*MS Azure Cloud*] is the hyperscaler platform on which the implementation of this solution has been based. In this solution, some of the main services of the cloud platform that interact with the OpenShift clusters are highlighted, like the Azure Container Registry and the Azure Key Vault for certificate management.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Azure Red Hat OpenShift*] is a service on Azure cloud that allows to deploy fully managed OpenShift clusters which provide a Kubernetes container platform. It provides the same functionalities as regular Red Hat OpenShift. The support is provided jointly by MS and Red Hat as well as the maintenance operations to keep it up to date and compliant with both MS and Red Hat's recommendations. In this solution, we follow the best practices included in the Azure Landing Zone Accelerator for ARO to deploy it.

== Architectures

=== MS ARO ingress traffic configuration

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram for ARO ingress traffic configuration._

Figure 3 shows the recommended network configuration for the ingress traffic into the ARO cluster together with the main Azure services that will connect to it. 

It also shows how users can access the APIs for the applications running on the ARO cluster through the Azure Front Door service combined with Azure Private Link to create a private endpoint.

Connection to Azure Arc logging and monitoring services is recommended for cluster performance and usage analysis that will trigger recommendations to improve customer use of their clusters.


=== MS ARO egress traffic configuration

_Figure 4. Schematic diagram for ARO egress traffic configuration._

In Figure 4, we can see the recommended configuration for the egress traffic from the ARO cluster to the Internet. To filter this traffic the choice for the implementation is to use Azure Firewall service.

For users that need to access the ARO cluster itself, we recommend using Azure Bastion (jump box) service to connect to it. (A jump box is similar to  an SSH proxy that allows you to hide your server's SSH port from the internet, while still allowing authorized people to SSH in.  It can make attacking your servers more difficult.)
