* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *MS Azure Cloud* is the hyperscaler platform on which the implementation of this solution has been based. In this solution some of the main srevices of the cloud platform that interact with the OpenShift clusters are highlighted, like the Azure Container Registry and the Azure Key Vault for certificate management.

** *Azure Red Hat Openshift* is a service on Azure cloud that allows to deploy fully managed OpenShift clusters which provide a Kubernetes container platform. It provides the same functionalities as regular Red Hat Openshift. The support is provided jointly by MS and Red Hat as well as the maintenance operations to keep it up to date and compliant with both MS and Red Hat's recommendations. In this solution we follow the best practices included in the Azure Landing Zone Accelerator for ARO to deploy it.
