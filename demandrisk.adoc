== Use case
Reduce and mitigate the effects of two of the main demand risk use cases, *overstock* and *understock* events, in retail and other supply chains.

== Background

A fundamental goal for supply chains of physical goods is matching up available inventory with demand. 

You can have too little of something (understock). Everyone is familiar with this case from during the pandemic whether it involved waiting months for a new car or scrounging all the local markets for toilet paper. These examples illustrate two of the ways in which businesses can fail to align with customer demand. In the case of automobiles, shortages in key components like microprocessors constrained what manufacturers could build. In the case of toilet paper, a spike in consumer demand because people weren’t in offices while also buying whatever and whenever they could was most responsible for the shortfall.

But overstock is bad too. Products or components sitting on a shelf or in a warehouse represent capital that’s sitting idle. Furthermore, products can spoil. This latter problem is most obvious in the case of food and other perishables but it’s not limited to literal spoilage. Clothes can become last year’s style. The 2023 electronics gadget isn’t going to be worth as much once new models are announced at the Consumer Electronics Show the next year.

Therefore, inventory optimization is a critical element of any organization's fulfillment process. It represents a balancing act between two key aspects of that process.



=== Business problem

Inventory optimization is a critical element of any retail
organization’s fulfillment process. It represents a balancing act between
two key viewpoints in the fulfillment process.

The first viewpoint is *demand*. The business needs to understand their
current demand for products, goods, and services. There are two aspects
of demand, the current demand and the future demand. Current
demand asks the question: How many unsatisfied orders or requests do
we have in the system at this point in time? Future demand asks the
more difficult question: How many orders or requests do we expect to
have at some point in the future? This future point could be measured
in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and even years. The further into
the future, the harder it becomes to predict the demand.

The second viewpoint is *inventory*. The business needs to have a clear
understanding of all the inventory held within their fulfillment system.
An inventory management provides oversight of current inventory and
inventory changes due to purchases, performs analysis on sold products,
keeps consolidated stock data, and handles stock allocation. It also makes
decisions on reallocating goods between multiple warehouses and/or retail locations. 

_Inventory optimization_ is making sure the current and future demand is
accurately balanced against current and future inventory. Getting the
balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business.
Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and, in the worst case,
eventual collapse of the business.

To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any retail
business, this portfolio architecture will focus on the use cases where demand and inventory get out of balance.

|Business Problem |Solution
|Unusual events, such as the global pandemic, war or other international
incident, port issues, and waterway obstructions illustrate the need for
enterprises to build resilient supply chains. |Respond with
intelligence, speed, and confidence to reduce the impact of disruptions,
turning these events into opportunities to outperform and outcompete.

|Manual processes, limited capabilities of inventory management tools,
and global operations pose a challenge for enterprises to manage and act
on inventory and mitigate disruptions to meet actual demand. |Monitor
and manage network inventory availability and respond to disruptions
such as out-of-stock and overstock with alerts and recommended actions.

|The lack of pertinent product information and poor data flow across
partners lead to inefficient inventory management, waste, and lost
sales. |Gain detailed visibility into inventory characteristics at each
location.

|Use Case |The Problem |The Solution |The Benefits and Implications
|Reduce out of stock (OOS) or approaching out of stock (AOOS) conditions
|Out of stock situations lead to lost revenue and decreased brand /
retailer loyalty. |SCIS Control Tower monitors inventory levels at all
locations in a client’s network and creates items in the work queue when
revenue is at risk. When drilling down on the item, users can see where
they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much
inventory can and should be transferred to the OOS / AOOS locations.
|Action can be taken directly from the Control Tower user interface. OOS
situations are efficiently managed and AOOS is avoided with minimal
human intervention.

|Manage industrial and manufacturing critical supplies |Out of stock
situations lead to line outages, manufacturing delays, and lost revenue.
|SCIS Control Tower monitors inventory to request demand and creates
items in the work queue when delivery is at risk. When drilling down on
the item, users can see parts by SKU and location to see which supply is
at risk and take action to minimize impact. |Minimize production and parts
impact due to OOS / AOOS situations. Increase throughput and minimize
customer delays. Minimize expedited and remediation costs.

Inventory is managed by exception. Manage and predict inventory
exceptions such as: low inventory, stockouts, slow moving and aging
inventory. Optimize inventory transfers to mitigate these circumstances.

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram of understock use case._

Understock workflow steps:

. Inventory Analysis detects low stock levels and predicts inventory will
become unavailable sooner than originally expected.

. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the understock position.

. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from
stores, in-transit, warehouses plus future inventory positions

. Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand
Intelligence.

. Colleague (humans in loop) alerted and asked to take remediation action.

. The Colleague now triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: ordering more stock, adjusting stock positions within the existing Supply Chain, managing inventory held at existing stores/warehouses and moving existing inventory as appropriate.

=== Overstock

Figure 4 shows the schematic for the overstock use case.

Overstock workflow steps:

. Inventory Analysis detects high stock levels and predicts inventory will
not be sold as quickly as expected.

. Inventory Control Tower alerted to the overstock position.

. Inventory Control Tower collects current inventory positions from
stores, in-transit, and warehouses plus future inventory positions.

. Inventory Control Tower collects future demand requirements from Demand
Intelligence.

. Colleague (the humans in the loop) alerted and asked to take remediation action.

. The Colleague now triggers Business Automation to remediate stock levels using a combination of options, including: ordering more stock, adjusting stock positions within the existing Supply Chain, managing inventory held at existing stores/warehouses and moving existing inventory as appropriate.

== Action Guide

From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your
organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital
supply chain:

* Automation
* Sustainability
* Modernization

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
| |Actionable Step |Implementation details
|Automation |Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation
|Integrate data from multiple systems to get enterprise-wide view of
changes in inventory demand. Monitor and analyze near real-time data

|Automation |Accelerate automation in extended workflows |As an example,
in the Reduce out of stock (OOS) or approaching out of stock (AOOS)
conditions, a SCIS Control Tower monitors inventory levels at all
locations in a client’s network and creates items in the work queue when
revenue is at risk.

|Automation |Amp up AI to make workflows smarter |When users are
inspecting inventory items by drilling down on the item, users see where
they have available inventory and receive recommendations about how much
inventory can and should be transferred to the OOS / AOOS locations.
These recommendations are based on adding automation and AI to make
workflows smarter.

|Sustainability |Include sustainability commitments in decision making
|Integrate sustainability metrics in overstock and understock decision
making.

|Modernization |Modernization for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid
cloud platforms |The decision for a future, Kubernetes-based enterprise
platform is defining the standards for development, deployment and
operations tools and processes for years to come and thus represents a
foundational decision point.
