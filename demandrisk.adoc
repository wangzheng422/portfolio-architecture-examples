== Demand risk

To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any
business, we will focus on one of the main demand risk use cases:
understock and overstock. We will start by defining the business problem
and the two main use cases: understock and overstock, describe the
challenges and business drivers organizations face. Next, we will
provide an action guide, provide an overview of the solution, show a
schematic of the two use cases, understock and overstock, and conclude
with the technology used in the solution.

For a comprehensive inventory solution overview, see
link:supplychain.md[Inventory Optimization].

=== Business problem

Inventory optimization is a critical element of any retail
organisation’s fulfilment process. It represents a balancing act between
two key viewpoints in the fulfilment process.

The first viewpoint is *demand*. The business needs to understand their
current demand for products, goods and services. There are two aspects
of demand, the ``current'' demand and the ``future'' demand. Current
demand asks the question, ``how many unsatisfied orders or requests do
we have in the system at this point in time?'' Future demand asks the
more difficult question, ``how many orders or requests do we expect to
have at some point in the future?'' This future point could be measured
in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and even years. The further into
the future, the harder it becomes to predict the demand.

The second viewpoint is *inventory*. The business needs to have a clear
understanding of all the inventory held within their fulfilment system.
An inventory management provides oversight of current inventory and
inventory changes due to purchases. Performs analysis on sold products,
keeps consolidated stock data, and handles stock allocation. Makes
decision on reallocation of goods between multiple warehouses. Inventory
is stock or inventory available for sale to customers. As with demand,
inventory has two aspects, ``current'' and ``future'' inventory. Current
inventory asks two questions, ``how many items of a particular product
do I have available at this point in time?'' and ``where are those items
located?'' Future inventory asks the question, ``how much inventory is
required at some point in the future''. As with demand, this future
point could range from minutes to years and becomes increasingly harder
to predict the further into the future.

_Inventory optimization_ is making sure the current and future demand is
accurately balanced against current and future inventory. Getting the
balance correct leads to a successful and profitable retail business.
Getting the balance wrong leads to failure and in the worst case,
eventual collapse of the business.

To demonstrate the importance of inventory optimization for any retail
business, this document will focus on main use cases of demand and
inventory.

=== Use cases

Two main issues are represented by demand risk.

*Understock* refers to not holding sufficient inventory to meet current
demand. This includes not having enough inventory today but also, not
having enough inventory in the very near future that could be used to
meet the demand. The end result is disappointed customers who order but
don’t get fulfillment or can’t order due to lack of product. This
``stock out'' position often represents between 4-8% of total sales
lost, but can also be a failed opportunity to satisfy customer in other
ways, through up-sell and cross-sell. KPIs that can help avoid an under
stock or stock-out position. include inventory turn over rate, days on
hand and lead time (how long it takes to get more inventory from a
supplier).

*Overstock* refers to holding more stock than required to meet current
and future demand. This results in additional costs to store then
dispose of overstocked items via discounts, selling at a loss or
destruction. Whilst understock is measured in customer satisfaction and
loss of future opportunity, overstock has direct impact on the
bottom-line costs and profitability of the business. KPIS relevant to
overstock include, holding costs, dead stock (in-stock items failing to
sell) and inventory turnover rates.

=== Challenges / Business Drivers

*Challenges*

* Maintaining inventory control of high value items to minimize loss and
associated cost.
* When stores receive inventory from warehouse or direct from suppliers,
how to manage direct ship is a real challenge for each store as it has
to be managed at the store level.
* Forecasting inventory levels intelligently to meet customer demand.
* Efficiently handle overstocking and understocking events

*Drivers*

* Inventory turnover - if improve by 2 or 3 times then will drive bigger
profit
* Managing capacity - across the enterpriese and with suppliers
* Enhanced customer experience with inventory matching customer demnd
* Handling overstock and understock events
