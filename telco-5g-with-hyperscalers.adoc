5G is the latest evolution of wireless mobile technology. In this portfolio architecture we'll discuss an 5G solution built with open source technologies at core, that can work across any hyperscaler.

*Use case:* Build an adaptable, on-demand infrastructure services for 5G Core that can deliver across diverse use
cases with minimal CAPEX and OPEX.

== The technology

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. OpenShift enables 5G core by supporting functionalities and operational features like automated deployment, intelligent workload placement, dynamic scaling, hitless upgrades, and self healing.

** *Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform* is a foundation for building and operating automation across an organization.
The platform includes all the tools needed to implement enterprise-wide automation. It enables cluster and network operations administrators to automate deployment of functional components across hybrid cloud.


** *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management* for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with
built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and
enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds. Its used for persistent storage across  clusters across hybrid cloud.

Conceptually, the 5G solution stack with hyperscalers can be categorized into:

** *Infrastructure*

** *Application Platform*

** *Applications*

** *Platform Management and Application Orchestration*

Infrastructure provides necessary compute, network and storage resources to the application platform. Application platform accommodates the applications with declarative desired state consistency with facilities to perform scaling, healing and monitoring. Applications provides the business logic they are aimed to deliver in a homogenous performant way (ie wider, stronger, faster 5G). Management and orchestration allows dynamic scaling of end-to-end 5G solution, across multiple locations with automation.

The messages from endpoints and Radio Access Network (RAN) are routed to the OpenShift clusters running on AWS and on AWS Outposts in user plane/multi-access edge.

User Plane Function (UPF) is responsible for packet processing and traffic aggregation of user traffic.

Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and Session Management Function (SMF) are part of the control plane. AMF is responsible for handling connections and mobility management tasks while SMF handles session management. AMF receives connection and session-related info from the end devices, passing the session info to SMF, which establishes sessions by using UPF.

Policy Control Function (PCF) provides a framework for creating policies to be consumed by the other control plane network functions.

Authentication Server Function (AUSF) provides authentication and Unified Data Management (UDM) ensuring user identification, authorization and subscription management.

The following components provide the supplementary services:

Network Repository Function (NRF) is used by AMF to select the correct SMF out of the available pool.

NRF and Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF) work together to support network slicing capabilities.

Network Exposure Function (NEF) exposes 5G services and resources so third-party apps can more securely access 5G services.

Application Function (AF) exposes an application layer for interacting with 5G network resources, retrieving resource info from PCF and exposing them.

The management service is provided by Element Management System/Container Network Function Manager (EMS/CNFM) is responsible for the application’s life cycle: provisioning, configuration, scaling, updates, etc. This component would be application-specific, and depending on the vendor implementation, would interact with the platform and the application over open or proprietary API interfaces. This component is optional and its functionality might be rolled into the Orchestrator or implemented using Operators.

OpenShift Service Mesh is used for service discovery and exposure, and as a mechanism for specialized network handling, certificate management, etc.
