Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied
where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a
small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele.

*Use case:* Optimizing delivery routing, automating rostering of staff, and improving efficiency of tasks across
multiple stores.

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat Integration* is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and
data across hybrid infrastructures.

** *Red Hat 3scale API Management* makes it easy to manage your APIs. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize
your APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

The business owners and developers are providing the goals, constraints, and resources to the retail planning services
which then take any external triggers, external input, and data constraints from the
link:retaildataframework.adoc[retail data framework] that might apply. Processes and data decisions might be needed to
finalise any optimisation planning and then all of this is used to generate the planning. This plan is then sent
to the integration services to then push to eventual external third-party systems and the retail systems for further
processing out to the stores.

== Vaccine optimisation

The business owners and developers are providing the goals, constraints, and resources to the vaccine planning services
which then take any external triggers, external input, and data constraints from the vaccine centre data, vaccine
supply data, and patient (customer) data that might apply. The external planners need to have a view of the status of
the planning calculations and the scheduling process so they are given access through and API management element. The
final vaccine schedule is then sent to the integration services to then ensure the vaccine appointments are sent the
new schedule in a mobile application for the consumer to be notified.
