_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Creating a framework for access to retail data from customers, stock, stores, and staff across multiple
internal teams.

*Background:* Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. A data framework refers to the process of managing enterprise retail data. The framework or system sets
the guidelines and rules of engagement for business and management activities, especially those that deal with or
result in the creation and manipulation of data.

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/ocp-self-managed-trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Runtimes*] helps organizations use the cloud delivery model and simplify continuous delivery of
applications, the cloud-native way. Built on proven open source technologies, it also provides development teams
multiple modernization options to enable a smooth transition to the cloud for existing applications. 

https://www.redhat.com/en/products/integration?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Integration*] is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and
data across hybrid infrastructures. 

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/3scale?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat 3scale API Management*] makes it easy to manage your APIs. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize
your APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/process-automation-manager?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Business Automation*] is an application development platform that enables developers and business experts
to create cloud-native applications that automate business operations.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Data Science*] is a managed cloud service for data scientists and developers of intelligent
applications. It provides a fully supported sandbox in which to rapidly develop, train, and test machine learning (ML)
models in the public cloud before deploying in production.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations*] is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/data-foundation/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux*] is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/server/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

This is a complex data story where many aspects of the retail organization are linked to, feeding and leveraging output
from this data framework; stores, central offices, colleagues, store associates, IoT devices, shopper insights,
customer analytics, point of sale analytics, and much more. All of this input arrives through the API management by way
of web applications (to simplify by grouping all access together) and is processed through data validation
microservices. Data is also cached here for performance reasons, keeping it close to the application for access. The
data is persisted in some form, shown here going through the data integration services to many different forms of data
storage. The incoming data sets up and event stream, to process the messages through the process that is relating to
this specific data request. The process will ensure message transformation if needed, do all the compliance validation
checks before leveraging the integration services to access the core platform or data science platform as needed.

The core platform can be seen as the central IT location for other compliance and regulatory tooling, data governance
tooling, auditing tooling, and centralized authentication and authorisation tooling. The data science platform is
where the business intelligence tooling, data visualization tooling, and data science tooling is found.
