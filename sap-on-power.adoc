_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Modernize regulated and restricted SAP environments with high scalable IBM Power server in a fully automated way for the complete life cycle, which includes day2 operations and reduces infrastructure and personal costs.

*Background:*
SAP customers need to migrate to the new suite SAP S/4HANA[1] by 2027. That is a very complex process during which all the customer custom code must be reviewed and if still useful, taken out of the SAP backend so that further upgrade processes are simplified and accelerated. The requirements of regulated and restricted environments must also be considered and complied with.

Regardless of the above migration plan on the part of SAP, *Red Hat Virtualization* customers with SAP or other workloads must migrate to an alternative hypervisor/solution by August 31, 2024[2].

_[1] S/4HANA is the follow on product to the SAP Business Suite, it is the latest offering from SAP.  It runs only on the HANA database, which is an in-memory database developed and tuned by SAP for faster performance and real-time reporting._

== Solution overview 
The purpose of this solution is to completely automate the deployment of SAP HANA DB and SAP Application components based on IBM PowerVC, RHEL and pacemaker as high availability solution in a regulated and restricted environment.

This architecture covers generic information on the design of the infrastructure in a solution pattern:

* IBM Power
* IBM PowerVC
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux with Satellite for SAP
* Red Hat Satellite
* Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
* Red Hat Insights
* SAP S4/HANA
* other SAP NetWeaver based Applications
* SAP HANA
* AnyDB (e.g. Oracle DB, IBM DB2, SAP ASE)


The following view shows which business drivers are to be covered by the solution. In addition, "Scaled SAP in regulated and restricted environments" is a solution that can be reproduced and is used by various customers. It is based on decades of experience with state-of-the-art technology.

*Why customers decide to use IBM Power servers?*

* On-premise Cloud Architecture
* Highly efficient and secure virtualization
* Optimal maintenance concept through Live Partition Mobility
* Effective use of resources leads to energy savings

*Why customers decide to use automation?*

* Standardized approaches, such as platform as code and improved SLAs
* Reproduceable architecture
* Time to market by accelerated life cycle workflows

== Logical diagrams

Figure 2 provides a diagram of the architecture showing the major components and where they logically reside.

_Figure 2. Logical diagram of the architecture._

The logical overview shows that all components function smoothly in a disconnected or air-gapped environment and can be operated according to the highest safety standards.
Red Hat's and IBM's CDN was included because the packages have to be downloaded and deployed in their own data center. Access to other websites is not required after the initial deployment.


== Technology

The following hardware and technology were chosen for this solution:

====

https://www.ibm.com/power[*IBM Power Server*]
IBM Power is known for its scalability and performance with the most demanding workloads, its superior virtualization and management features for flexibility, its security with better isolation and integrated stack, and its leading availability.

https://www.ibm.com/de-de/products/powervc[*IBM PowerVC Virtualization*]
IBM PowerVC is based on OpenStack. It provides simplified virtualization management and cloud deployments for IBM AIX , IBM i and Linux virtual machines (VMs) running on IBM Power Systems.

Example of SAP on PowerVC Deployment:
https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/SAP+HANA+for+IBM+Power+Systems+-+PowerVC+Deployment/1_ohwmudpk[*SAP HANA Deployment on IBM Power and PowerVC*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions*]
RHEL for SAP is combining an intelligent operating system with predictive management tools and SAP-specific content. Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions provides a single, consistent, highly available foundation for business-critical SAP and non-SAP workloads. It also includes the Red Hat Satellite product portfolio and the Red Hat Insights SaaS offering.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite[*Red Hat Satellite*] includes Satellite and Cloud Connector, provides the capability to gather anonymized configuration information from the SAP hosts and send that anonymized data to Insights Platform (on Red Hat’s SaaS). It helps also with proactive detection and automatic remediation of potential issues. Satellite manages the lifecycle of the SAP servers, applying the packages, security fixes, etc., that they need to comply with SAP’s and Red Hat’s recommendations and consistent between them.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights[*Red Hat Insights*] receives the anonymized data of the SAP hosts from Satellite and makes it available to Red Hat Insights services the customer is subscribed to. It is a rule-based SaaS and it has dedicated rules for SAP hosts that are based on SAP's and Red Hat's recommendations and it detects and alerts when a host is not compliant with all these recommendations.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*]
Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is used for the automated life cycle of solution for all components, which leads to increased efficiency and stability in production. It is the framework used in this solution to run the remediation Ansible playbooks in the hosts that will correct the situations that could lead to a failure or issue. For example, modifying a kernel memory parameter that can cause a bad performance of the SAP HANA DB or applying a certain level of an OS package that is needed for a particular version of SAP Netweaver.

Ansible Collections for IBM Power extend the benefits of Ansible automation to Power enterprise customers.
Certified Collections are also available for AIX, IBM i, VIOS, HMC and Linux for Power. The Power pipeline includes additional collections to automate PowerHA, SAP HANA (on AIX and IBM i) and Oracle operations.

== Architectures

All products build the solution stack in the technology capture below.

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the architecture._

The schematic overview explains the communication ways between all components and products. One of the importants part is the infrastructure management part, where Ansible Automation Platform, Satellite and the local repository is located.
If content from the public network / internet for the life cycle propose is needed then the communication goes through the proxy and firewall to the permitted CDNs.
All the data is located on one or several storages. The primary storage tier is provided by SAN storage (FC or NVMe-o-Fabric) and the secondary storage tier provides File storage (NFS) as service and is also need by SAP as shared directory between the SAP instances. 

The requirements of enterprise customers show that a high level of automation with standardised approaches, such as platform as code, is necessary to ensure availability with the highest possible SLAs. Especially in critical infrastructures, it must be guaranteed and auditable.
With this solution we provide a lot of day 1 and day 2 taks which helps to achive the goals.
