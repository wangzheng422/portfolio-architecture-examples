_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Modernize regulated and restricted SAP environments with high scaleable IBM Power server in a fully automated way for the complete life cycle, which includes day2 operations and reduces infrastructure and personal costs.

*Background:*
SAP customers need to migrate to the new suite SAP S/4HANA[1] by 2027. That is a very complex process during which all the customer custom code must be reviewed and if still useful, taken out of the SAP backend so that further upgrade processes are simplified and accelerated. The requirements of regulated and restricted environments must also be considered and complied with.

Regardless of the above migration plan on the part of SAP, *Red Hat Virtualization* customers with SAP or other workloads must migrate to an alternative hypervisor by August 31, 2024[2].

[1] S/4HANA is short for SAP Business Suite 4 HANA. As the fourth version of the SAP Business Suite, it is the latest offering from SAP.  It runs only on the HANA database, which is an in-memory database developed and tuned by SAP for faster performance and real-time reporting.

== Solution summary 
The purpose of this solution is to completely automate with Ansibe the deployment of SAP HANA DB and SAP Application components based on IBM PowerVC, RHEL and pacemaker as high availability solution in a regulated and restricted environment.

This architecture covers generic information on the design of the infrastructure in a solution pattern:
* IBM Power
** IBM Power is known for its scalability and performance with the most demanding workloads.
* IBM PowerVC
** IBM PowerVC provides simplified virtualisation management and cloud deployments
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux with Smart Management for SAP
** Smart Management for SAP helps about the life cycle management of all SAP hosts with proactive detection and automatic remediation of potential issues
* Red Hat Satellite
** Red Hat Satellite manages the servers and 
* Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform manages the life cycle of the RHEL servers.
** Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is used for the automated life cycle of solution for all components.
* optional: Red Hat Insights
** Red Hat Insights detects with SAP specific rules potential problems.

== The hardware and technology

The following hardware and technology was chosen for this solution:

====

https://www.ibm.com/power
IBM Power is known for its scalability and performance with the most demanding workloads, its superior virtualization and management features for flexibility, its security with better isolation and integrated stack, and its leading availability for 13 years running.

https://www.ibm.com/de-de/products/powervc
IBM® PowerVC is based on OpenStack. It provides simplified virtualisation management and cloud deployments for IBM AIX , IBM i and Linux virtual machines (VMs) running on IBM Power® Systems.

Example of SAP on PowerVC Deployment:

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions*] is combining an intelligent operating system with predictive management tools and SAP-specific content. Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions provides a single, consistent, highly available foundation for business-critical SAP and non-SAP workloads.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Insights*] receives the anonymized data of the SAP hosts from Smart Management and makes it available to the Insights services the customer is subscribed to. It is a rule-based SaaS and it has dedicated rules for SAP hosts that are based on SAP's and Red Hat's recommendations and it detects and alerts when a host is not compliant with all these
recommendations.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/smart-management?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Smart Management*], which includes Satellite and Cloud Connector, provides the capability to gather anonymized configuration information from the SAP hosts and send that anonymized data to Insights Platform (on Red
Hat’s SaaS). Satellite manages the lifecycle of the SAP servers, applying the packages, security fixes, etc., that
they need to comply with SAP’s and Red Hat’s recommendations and consistent between them.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] is the framework used in this solution to run the remediation Ansible playbooks in the hosts that will correct the situations that could lead to a failure or issue. For example, modifying
a kernel memory parameter that can cause a bad performance of the SAP HANA DB or applying a certain level of an OS
package that is needed for a particular version of SAP Netweaver.
