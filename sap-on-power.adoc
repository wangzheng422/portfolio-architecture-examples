_Updated November 2023._

_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all Red Hat architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

== Use case

Modernize regulated and restricted SAP environments using high scalable IBM Power servers in a fully automated way for the complete life cycle, which includes Day 2 operations and reduces infrastructure and labor costs.

== Background

SAP customers need to migrate to the new suite SAP S/4HANA[1] by 2027. That is a very complex process during which all the customer custom code must be reviewed and, if still useful, taken out of the SAP backend so that further upgrade processes are simplified and accelerated. The requirements of regulated and restricted environments must also be considered and complied with.

Regardless of the above migration plan on the part of SAP, *Red Hat Virtualization* customers with SAP or other workloads must migrate to an alternative hypervisor/solution by August 31, 2024[2].

_[1] SAP S/4HANA is the follow on product to the SAP Business Suite; it is the latest offering from SAP.  It runs only on the HANA database, which is an in-memory database developed and tuned by SAP for faster performance and real-time reporting._

== Solution overview 
The purpose of this solution is to completely automate the deployment of SAP HANA DB and SAP Application components based on IBM PowerVC, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Pacemaker (an open source cluster resource manager that ships with Linux) high availability solution in a regulated and restricted environment.

"Scaled SAP in regulated and restricted environments" is a solution that can be reproduced and is used by multiple customers. It is based on decades of experience with state-of-the-art practices.

_Figure 2. Logical diagram of the architecture._

The logical overview shows that all components function smoothly in a disconnected or air-gapped environment and can be operated according to the highest  standards.
Red Hat's and IBM's CDNs were included because the packages have to be downloaded and deployed in their own data center. Access to other websites is not required after the initial deployment.


== Technology

The following hardware and technology were chosen for this solution:


https://www.ibm.com/power[*IBM Power Server*]
IBM Power is known for its scalability and performance with the most demanding workloads, its superior virtualization and management features for flexibility, its security with better isolation and integrated stack, and its leading availability.
It was chosen for this solution because of:

* On-premise Cloud Architecture
* Highly efficient and secure virtualization
* Optimal maintenance concept through Live Partition Mobility
* Effective use of resources leading to energy savings

https://www.ibm.com/de-de/products/powervc[*IBM PowerVC Virtualization*]
is based on OpenStack. It provides simplified virtualization management and cloud deployments for IBM AIX , IBM i, and Linux virtual machines (VMs) running on IBM Power Systems.

Example of SAP on PowerVC Deployment:
https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/SAP+HANA+for+IBM+Power+Systems+-+PowerVC+Deployment/1_ohwmudpk[*SAP HANA Deployment on IBM Power and PowerVC*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions*]
for SAP Solutions combines an intelligent operating system with predictive management tools and SAP-specific content. It provides a single, consistent, highly available foundation for business-critical SAP and non-SAP workloads and also includes the Red Hat Satellite product portfolio with the Red Hat Insights SaaS offering. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/sap/trial[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Satellite*] includes Satellite and Cloud Connector, which provides direct integration between Red Hat Insights and on-premise Red Hat Satellite infrastructure. In addition, the Insights client provides the capability to gather anonymized configuration information from the SAP hosts and send that anonymized data to Red Hat's SaaS Insights Platform. This helps with proactive detection and automatic remediation of potential issues. Satellite manages the lifecycle of the SAP servers, applying the packages, security fixes, etc., that they need to comply with SAP’s and Red Hat’s recommendations and maintain consistency between them.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Insights (SaaS)*] receives the anonymized data of the SAP hosts from Satellite and makes it available to Red Hat Insights services the customer is subscribed to. It is a rule-based SaaS and it has dedicated rules for SAP hosts that are based on SAP's and Red Hat's recommendations; it detects and alerts when a host is not compliant with all these recommendations.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*]
Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is used for the automated lifecycle management for all components, which leads to increased efficiency and stability in production. It is the framework used in this solution to run the remediation Ansible playbooks in the hosts that will correct the situations that could lead to a failure or issue. For example, modifying a kernel memory parameter can cause poor performance of the SAP HANA DB. Or a certain level of an operating system package may be needed for a particular version of SAP NetWeaver. Automation is essential to enable standardized approaches (such as platform-as-code and reproducible architectures)), to improve SLAs, and to achieve shorter time to market through accelerated workflows. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

Ansible Collections for IBM Power extend the benefits of Ansible automation to Power enterprise customers.
Certified Collections are also available for AIX, IBM i, VIOS, HMC and Linux for Power. The Power pipeline includes additional collections to automate PowerHA, SAP HANA (on AIX and IBM i) and Oracle operations.

https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html[*SAP S4/HANA*] is the latest enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution released by SAP, a successor to SAP R/3 and SAP ECC. It only runs on SAP HANA database (as opposed to the others that can also run on other databases like Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, or IBM DB2). The main idea behind the newer product is to cover most of company processes in just one product, thus integrating  functions that were historically covered by SAP's own customer relationship management, supplier relationship mangement, and supply chain management products. It is important to note that the soution shown in this architecture can alternatively involve SAP S/4HANA or its predecessor ERP solutions.

https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/hana/what-is-sap-hana.html[*SAP HANA*] is an in-memory database that keeps the working data in memory for much faster access to it relative to fetching it from disk every time it is accessed. The data is also persisted to disk. It also performs analytics and includes extract, transform, and load (ETL) capabilities. The solution presented in this architecture can be deployed using SAP HANA or any of the other databases supported by SAP.

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the architecture._

One of the importants parts is the infrastructure management part, where Ansible Automation Platform, Satellite, PowerVC as Virtualization Management, and the local repository is located.
If content from the public network / internet for the lifecycle process is needed, then the communication goes through the proxy and firewall to the permitted CDNs.
All the data is located on one or several storage systems. The primary storage tier is provided by SAN storage (FC or NVMe-oF) and the secondary storage tier provides File storage (NFS) as a service; SAP needs this as a shared directory between the SAP instances. 

The requirements of enterprise customers show that a high level of automation with standardized approaches, such as platform as code, is necessary to ensure availability with the highest possible SLAs. Especially in critical infrastructures, SLAs must be guaranteed and auditable.
The solution covered in this portfolio architecture can perform many Day 1 and Day 2 tasks to help achieve reliability and consistency goals.
