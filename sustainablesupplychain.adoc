== Sustainable supply chain

Businesses are looking for *sustainable supply chains*. Some of the
questions they ask:

* How can I ensure my products, vendors and partners along my supply
chain are aligned with my sustainability goals?
* Is my supply chain transparent and traceable?
* How can I get a handle on my Scope 3 emissions?

Businesses are seeking to balance the long-term imperative to protect
the planet with the short-term need to preserve the bottom line.

Examples of sustainability in business:

* Improving energy management efficiency using alternative power sources
and carbon accounting
* Deploying infrastructure that reduces GHG emissions, preserves water
resources and eliminates waste
* Operating dynamic and efficient supply chains to empower a circular
economy, encourage reuse, design out waste, promote sustainable
consumption and protect natural resources
* Enabling sustainable development by assessing risks and improving
resiliency while adhering to external regulations and development goals

In this article, we explore *sustainable supply chains*. Reduce waste,
cost-to-serve and logistics-related emissions by optimizing fulfillment
and delivery with trusted supply chain solutions that are powered by AI,
backed by blockchain, and built on an open, hybrid-cloud platform.

=== Challenges / Business drivers

*Challenges*

There are several challenges to overcome in the pursuit of becoming a
truly sustainable business:

* Upfront costs to becoming a sustainable business
* Difficuly in measuring and demonstrating lowering green house gas
(GHG) emissions
* Customers are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products
* Creating a lower emissions business affects all business processes and
departments

*Business drivers*

* Increase creation and use of sustainable products
* Identify and monitor energy and emissions savings opportunities to
accelerate decarbonization
* Enhance customer experience with eco-friendly packaging
* Improve brand awareness by being known as a sustainable business
* Delight customers with green energy delivery fleet

=== Solution overview

This solution focuses on _Automation_ and _Modernization_ in our Action
Guide as shown in the following diagram:

image::./images/intro-marketectures/sustainablesupplychain-marketing-slide.png[solution overview]

The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into
three main categories as shown in the following diagram:

* Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such
as order management, facilities management. These systems can be
stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases.
* Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red
Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed
through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.
* Inventory Optimization platform
* Sustainability system acts as a key driver for automated product and
transport selection, in addition to reporting and creating goal-driven
outcomes.

=== Sustainable supply chain

The following diagram shows the schematic for the sustainability use
case to improve your supply chain.

image::./images/schematic-diagrams/sustainablesupplychain-sd.png[sustainability schematic]

Customer chooses items to buy online using the business app.

Determine sustainability posture by determining ESG indicator values.

Before providing cost and delivery options, provide customer
sustainability options â€“ equivalent greener items, later delivery day,
pickup option, etc. If customer opts into sustainability option order is
tagged so Supply Assurance Platform can honor that request.

Inventory fulfilment system updates inventory data.

Delivery Optimization system plays a key role in sustainability play. It
determines whether to contact 3PL or if in-house Route Optimization can
fulfill the requirements.

If 3PL is the only option, contact the sustainability approved 3PL
company to fulfill the order. 3PL company takes over the delivery flow
from here. If business has the means to fulfill the order continue with
next Step 6a.

Access underlying backend system via API Management

Alert the Order Fulfilment System (OFS) this special order via system
APIs.

OFS notifies the Warehouse Management System to package and get it ready
for delivery.

The Transport/Logistics System is alerted to schedule delivery.

Track the order, notify customer and provide real-time tracking.

Delivery department maintains the sustainability posture and upon final
delivery provides POD (electronic or paper) to customer.

All sub-systems are updated via the data fabric that helps maintain a
consistent view.
