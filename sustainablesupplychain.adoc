== Use case

Provide sustainable product and delivery options for customers as part of building sustainability into the supply chain more broadly.

== Background

A common definition of environmental sustainability is meeting the resource and services needs of current and future generations without compromising the health of the ecosystems that provide them. In addition to ongoing discussions around government regulation, investors and asset managers are increasingly demanding carbon disclosure from their portfolio companies. 

Even though specific actions taken by businesses are arguably still limited in overall impact, it’s nonetheless an increasingly prominent part of vendor, partner, and customer discussions. Many IT industry analysts also observe that sustainability projects can lead to a positive ROI. 

Environmental sustainability in organizations takes many forms including power consumption and using renewable sources where possible, deploying infrastructure that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, preserving water
resources, and eliminates waste, and generally balances the environmental costs associated with changes to processes and technologies with the benefits delivered. 

Operating dynamic and efficient supply chains to empower a circular
economy, encourage reuse and recycling, design out waste, promote sustainable
consumption, and protect natural resources is of particular relevance to the use case covered by this portfolio architecture. We'll first take a look at some of the challenges and drivers around sustainability broadly and then consider the specific case of the sustainability of an organization’s delivery systems as part of sustainable supply chain optimization.



=== Challenges and opportunities

Becoming a truly sustainable business isn’t easy. But simply ignoring sustainability is increasingly no longer tenable. Four challenges are:

* Upfront costs to becoming a sustainable business
* Difficulty in measuring and demonstrating that you are lowering greenhouse gas emissions
* Customers may not be willing to pay a potential premium for sustainable products
* Creating a lower emissions business given it affects all business processes and departments

But there are also drivers that encourage businesses to become sustainable—not least of which is that it can be good for the bottom line. These include:

* Increase the creation and use of sustainable products and provide sustainable customer choices
* Eliminate wasteful processes that don’t deliver value to the business or customers
* Identify and monitor energy and emissions savings opportunities to accelerate decarbonization
* Enhance the customer experience with eco-friendly packaging
* Improve brand awareness by being known as a sustainable business
* Meet customer requirements for environmental sustainability and reporting—for example with green-energy delivery fleets





== Solution overview

The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into
four main categories as shown in Figure 1:

* Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such
as order management and facilities management. These systems can be
stand-alone applications, on-premises and cloud services, and databases.
* Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red
Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed
through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.
* Inventory Optimization platform
* Sustainability system acts as a key driver for automated product and
transport selection, in addition to reporting and creating goal-driven
outcomes.

== Architecture

The sustainable supply chain depicted in Figure 3 shows the flow of a typical sustainability use case. While the customer is the main focus, partners or suppliers and third-party logistics (3PL) companies could be involved. At every point in the supply chain there is room for sustainability to be improved.

The business can determine its sustainability posture by determining the appropriate ESG indicator values. ESG metrics are indicators of a company's overall performance and risk profile across important environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) criteria. ESG metrics can be based on ESG and sustainability reporting standards, ESG rating frameworks from investors or analysts, or regulations like the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

_Figure 3. Overall schematic of sustainable supply chain use case including customer order fulfillment and delivery._

A customer kicks the process off by choosing items to buy online through a channel of their choosing. Before providing cost and delivery options, the business may provide the customer with sustainability options such as equivalent greener items, a later delivery day or batching with other orders, pickup options, and so forth. If a customer opts for any of these options, the order is tagged so the Supply Assurance Platform can honor that request. The Inventory Fulfillment System updates inventory data.

The Delivery Optimization System plays a key sustainability role. For example, it determines whether to contact 3PL (Third Party Logistics) or if in-house Route Optimization can fulfill the requirements. If 3PL is the only option, contact the sustainability-approved 3PL company to fulfill the order. 3PL company takes over the delivery flow from here. If the business has the means to fulfill the order, access the underlying backend system via API Management.

Otherwise, the Order Fulfillment System (OSF) is alerted of this special order via system APIs. OFS then notifies the Warehouse Management System to package and get it ready for delivery and the Transport/Logistics System is alerted to schedule delivery. The order is tracked in real-time and the customer is notified. Upon final delivery, proof-of-delivery is provided to the customer and all subsystems are updated via the data fabric to help maintain a consistent view of the supply chain and inventory.


== Action Guide
