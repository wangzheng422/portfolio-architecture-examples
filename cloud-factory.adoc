_Updated November 2023._

_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

== Use case

Deploy multiple private clouds based on the same infrastructure as code using different parameters and Ansible inventories.

== Background

Large enterprises may use this Cloud Factory architecture in order to deploy and manage their cloud in a modern and automated manner. 

== Solution overview
This architecture covers the deployment pertaining to one code base using the principles of Infrastructure as Code. This architecture addresses adapting to needs with specific clouds creating an efficient repeatable cloud deployment. 

This solution includess the following:

* Efficient and repeatable cloud deployment
* A life-cycle for the cloud itself
* Addresses specific needs with specific cloud

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:


https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/openstack-platform?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenStack Platform*] is an essential part of the factory where it virtualizes resources from hardware, organizes those
resources into clouds, and manages them.  Automation on top then provides access to hardware as needed.

https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-ceph/5[*IBM Storage Ceph*] is a software-defined storage solution that is simple to set up, supports automation, and easy to
scale and manage. It's a good Cloud factory choice because it's ability to store data as objects that can be easily
shared across a network.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] builds and operates automation as code. The platform acts as the centralized
control to execute the code for deployment and remediation based on the analysis of collected environment data. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Satellite*] manages the infrastructure and provides versioning and management of trusted softwares for containers,
RPMs, or libraries used in applications.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux*] is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system (OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing applications—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal, virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/server/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]


https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] is a unified platform to quickly build, modernize, and deploy both traditional and cloud-native applications at scale. It is packaged with a complete set of services for bringing apps to market on your choice of infrastructure. It’s based on an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, public cloud, and edge deployments. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/ocp-self-managed-trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the Cloud Factory solution showing two cloud deployments._

Figure 3 shows two cloud deployments. The first is the detached deployment head and the second is a cloud
environment.

*Detached Head Deployment*

Compute Deployment - The Openstack Platform is used to enable further computer nodes in deployed cloud environments.

Software Proxy - Pulls all the images from the deployment head and ensures that only trusted images are being rolled
out in the various cloud environments of choice.

*Cloud Environment*

The focus is on the key elements found in the deployments, such as the OpenStack compute controllers managing the
compute nodes. A tenant of these nodes is shown as the OpenShift Container Platform.

Figure 4 shows the solution details and the elements described above at a more detailed level.

The infrastructure starts with a deployment head, where the definitive software library is maintained through development and connections to the Red Hat content delivery network. Ansible is used to maintain and deliver playbooks
based infrastructure automation delivery to as many detached deployment heads as needed. Centralized monitoring and logging is also used within the deployment head.

In our research, the deployment head and detached deployment heads all ran on some form of virtualization platforms. Network services also supported them such as DNS and other security services.

The detached deployment heads were used to roll out and support the ‌cloud environments, using OpenStack Director to maintain compute nodes and controllers for both compute and storage.
