_Updated November 2023._

_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all Red Hat architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

== Use case

Minimizing the downtime of the maintenance on SAP hosts so that users and processes can continue to work
without perceived interruption.

== Background

SAP workloads are business-critical to a company and the maintenance windows are often very strict. This can make  it difficult for system administrators to finish updates and maintenance tasks properly in time. This architecture shows how organizations have dealt with this challenge.

== Solution overview
This portfolio architecture allows for application of OS patches, fixes, and system updates, as well as database patching and version updates, and SAP kernel updates— while users continue to work inside SAP, without disruption.
As shown in the overview diagram in Figure 1, this solution provides:

* Full lifecycle management of all SAP hosts 
* A compliant and consistent SAP landscape
* Avoiding disruptions during maintenance

== The technology
The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions*] combines an intelligent operating system with predictive management
tools and SAP-specific content, Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions provides a single, consistent, highly
available foundation for business-critical SAP and non-SAP workloads. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/server/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Satellite*] is the management element in this architecture, used for tracking, managing, auditing, and collecting data across the entire infrastructure to ensure that baselines are met. It has the capability to gather anonymized configuration information from the SAP hosts and send that anonymized data to Insights Platform (on Red Hat’s SaaS). Satellite manages the lifecycle of the SAP servers, applying the packages, security fixes, etc., that they need to be compliant with SAP’s and Red Hat’s recommendations and maintain consistency across the servers.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] is the framework used in this solution to run the Ansible remediation playbooks in the hosts that will correct the situations that could lead to a failure or issue. An example is modifying a kernel memory parameter that can cause poor performance of the SAP HANA database or applying a certain level of an operating system package that is needed for a particular version of SAP NetWeaver. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Inisghts*] continuously analyzes platforms and applications to predict risk, recommend actions, and track costs so enterprises can better manage hybrid cloud environments.

== Architectures
=== Near zero downtime network overview
Figures 3 and 4 show a schematic diagram of the solution from a network and data flows perspective respectively

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram of solution focusing on the network connections._

SAP HANA is the only database for which this particular solution, as described, has been implemented by customers. However, it could potentially be implemented for other databases supported by SAP like IBM DB2 using its high availability disaster recovery (HADR) capability and triggering the fail-over of the resources with Ansible playbooks just as it is done in this implementation with SAP HANA.

On the application side we can have any SAP NetWeaver-based application (either the new suite built on SAP S/4HANA or legacy systems based on SAP NetWeaver like SAP NetWeaver itself, SAP Business Warehouse, SAP Process Integration and Orchestration - PO/PI -, etc.). The application hosts are connected with the SAP HANA database hosts and all these servers that host SAP workloads are connected with those belonging to the Infrastructure Management tier, to both the Automation orchestration (Ansible Automation Platform) and to Satellite.

_Figure 4. Schematic diagram of solution focusing on the data flows._

All the SAP hosts send status data to Satellite, which is in charge of their lifecycle management. The database tier, the application tier, or both are clustered. So we have a Pacemaker cluster of the SAP HANA database. The deployment of the database can be scale-up (with just two servers with the exact same instance being replicated in real-time) or scale-out (with the different services of the database spread across multiple nodes in order to have larger resources). Both models can be clustered. Alternatively or in addition, there can be a Pacemaker cluster of the application (SAP S/4HANA or any other SAP NetWeaver based one). The Red Hat Enterprise Linux High Availability Add-On based on Pacemaker has specific resources for SAP HANA and also for the application tier.

The flow represented in Figure 4 is the following:

The Satellite server applies the packages, security fixes, etc., to the primary node of the target cluster (database cluster or application cluster; SAP NetWeaver or SAP S/4HANA). If the intervention is an SAP HANA upgrade (database cluster) or an SAP application cluster kernel upgrade, the Automation Orchestration (Ansible Automation Platform) runs a playbook for the upgrade in the primary node of the target cluster.  (The SAP kernel in the application cluster is different from the operating system kernel; it is another layer of binaries specific to the SAP application.)

If the maintenance is in the SAP HANA hosts, once the intervention is finished in the primary node, the Automation Orchestration runs a playbook in any of the nodes of the cluster. This moves the virtual IP to the other node so that the application servers can connect to it and keep working. Given the SAP application’s ‘suspend DB connection’ feature is used, no transactions will be committed to the database until the virtual IP failover is done; this takes less than one second so users will not perceive any disconnection. The Automation Orchestration will also run another playbook on any of the cluster nodes to change the direction of the SAP HANA System Replication, so that the node where the maintenance has already been done becomes the primary of this replication (primary node). If the maintenance is on the SAP application (NetWeaver or S/4HANA) cluster, the cluster resources will be moved while the primary node is under maintenance. This includes the SAP instance (ASCS or ERS, depending upon what is on the node) and the filesystems with the work and profile directories of the instance.

The Satellite server performs the intervention in the former primary node of the cluster. As in the first step of the data flow, if the intervention is an SAP HANA upgrade or an SAP kernel upgrade, the Automation Orchestration will run a playbook against the former primary node of the cluster.

After the intervention has been finished we can revert to the initial configuration of primary and secondary nodes of the cluster or keep the current one.
