DevSecOps with Red Hat is not just about helping our customers with their application pipeline in a containerized environment. We
can help customers implement DevSecOps no matter where they are in their journey of creating applications faster and securely on top
of a secure infrastructure. We can help customers tackle the culture and process component of DevSecOps with the expertise in our
Global Transformation Office and Innovation Labs , where we have helped many customers get jump started in DevSecOps in a residency
style experience. Our portfolio provides customers the technologies to build security into their applications on top of a secure
infrastructure with management and automation tools to quickly adapt and integrate with security partner ecosystem tooling for
comprehensive DevSecOps. In addition we help customers implement DevSecOps with culture and process in mind (such as organizational
policy and business guidelines) with services we offer in both Red Hat consulting and Innovation labs and provide training and
certification courses specific to security and DevOps.
