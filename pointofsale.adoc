_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Simplifying and modernizing central management of distributed point-of-sale devices with built in support for container based applications.


*Background:* Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. A point of sale, or point of purchase, is where you ring up customers. When customers check out online,
walk up to your counter, or pick out an item from your stand or booth, they're at the point of sale. Your point-of-sale
system is the hardware and software that enables your business to make those sales.

PoS systems are critical to businesses selling products and services because they help enable:

. Improved efficiency: PoS systems can help businesses improve efficiency by automating many of the tasks involved in sales and inventory management. This can free up employees to focus on other tasks, such as customer service.
. Increased sales: PoS systems can help businesses increase sales by providing insights into customer behavior and trends. This information can be used to create targeted marketing campaigns and promotions.
. Better customer service: PoS systems can help businesses provide better customer service by providing a more efficient and convenient checkout process. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.


== Solution overview

As shown in Figure 1, there are several important considerations that apply across PoS systems in general which will affect the degree to which a business can drive the types of value listed above:

====
*Business Drivers for Point of Sale*

. Remote management of all PoS 
. Consistency of PoS environment—including security and updates
. Automated build, manage, and deployment

_Figure 3. Schematic diagram for PoS image delivery._

Figure 3 shows a solution to deliver images of point of sale devices and store applications across diverse retail environments. It tackles the challenges of standardizing support for both legacy infrastructure at the point of sale, while also positioning a retail organization for the cloud-native development future of their business.

The SKU Catalog is maintained with available items for sale in the running inventory. The sales data cache is where all sales activities are collected and held for sharing to the retail organization. Point of sale is an onsite application and is the main focus of providing an end point application image pipeline for use throughout the retail organization.

The store server is a part of the infrastructure that hosts the elements needed to facilitate on-site point of sale image pipelines and the daily management of communication, sales data, and stock control information. The SKU Catalog takes input from each point of sale in the store. The image cache hosts the retail organizations centrally developed collection of point of sale images.
