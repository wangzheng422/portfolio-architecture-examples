Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied
where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a
small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele.

*Use case:* Simplifying and modernizing central management of distributed point-of-sale devices with built in support
for container based applications.

The above diagram demonstrates a solution to deliver images of point of sale devices and store applications across
diverse retail landscapes. It tackles the challenges of standardizing how to support both legacy infrastructure needs
at the point of sale, as well as positioning a retail organization for the cloud native development future of their
business.

The SKU Catalog is maintained with available items for sale in the running inventory. The sales data cache is where
all sales activities are collected and held for sharing to the retail organization. Point of sale is an onsite
application and is the main focus of providing an end point application image pipeline for use throughout the retail
organisation.

The store server is a part of the infrastructure that hosts the elements needed to facilitate on site point of sale
image pipelines and the daily management of communication, sales data, and stock control information. The SKU Catalog
takes input from each point of sale in the store. The image cache hosts the retail organizations centrally developed
collection of point of sale images.
