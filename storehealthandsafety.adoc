Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied
where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a
small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele.

*Use case:* Managing effective in-store compliance, health & safety, and employee checks and procedures.

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat Integration* is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and
data across hybrid infrastructures.

** *Red Hat 3scale API Management* makes it easy to manage your APIs. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize
your APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

The retail store and health safety is a case of capturing compliancy and processes for a broad range of store locations
across the organisation. It requires input from suppliers, customers, store associates, and vendors that can be both
internal and external to the stores themselves. Access via applications, web front ends, and devices uses API
management to access the store processes. Triggering a process often triggers some sub-set of the health and safety
processes that lean on the local store rules and helath and safety rules for determining actions needed. Should
processes require human task intervention, then the API management provides the external parties access to complete
their tasks. Processes might need to take action in the direction of health and safety suppliers, for example, ordering
new fire extinguishers or safety equipment using the supplier microservices. Actions taken towards external backend
systems can be local to the store, internal to the organisation but remote to the store, or to some remote third-party
system using integration microservices. Finally, data for the retail organisation uses data integration microservices
to access the link:retaildataframework.adoc[retail data framework architecture].
