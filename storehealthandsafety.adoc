_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Managing effective in-store compliance, health & safety, and employee checks and procedures.

*Background:* Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Store health and safety is all about managing risks to protect workers and stores. In a global context,
health and safety is also an essential part of the movement towards sustainable operational growth.

The retail store and health safety is a case of capturing compliancy and processes for a broad range of store locations across the organization. It requires input from suppliers, customers, store associates, and vendors that can be both internal and external to the stores themselves. Access via applications, web front ends, and devices uses API management to access the store processes. Triggering a process often triggers a subset of the health and safety processes that lean on the local store rules and health and safety rules for determining actions needed. Should processes require human task intervention, then the API management provides the external parties access to complete their tasks. Processes might need to take action toward health and safety suppliers, for example, ordering new fire extinguishers or safety equipment using the supplier microservices. Actions taken towards external backend systems can be local to the store, internal to the organization but remote to the store, or to some remote third-party system using integration microservices.
