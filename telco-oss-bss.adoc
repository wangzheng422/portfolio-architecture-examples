Cloud-ready OSS and BSS architectures can help telco network operators provide next-gen 5G and 6G communication solutions more efficiently and reliably.
Operational support systems (OSS) are the information processing systems that manage communications networks. These systems allow an organization to coordinate customers, services, resources, processes, and activities. They assist service providers in designing, building, operating, and maintaining communications networks.
Business support systems (BSS) provide business and customer-facing functionality. BSS tools allow an organization to connect with partners and customers (using services called customer relationship management, or CRM), create offerings, issue bills to customers, and generate inter-business transactions such as settlements and point-of-interconnect.

== The technology
The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
OpenShift enables OSS/BSS by supporting functionalities and operational features like automated deployment, intelligent
workload placement, dynamic scaling, hitless upgrades, and self healing.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] is a foundation for building and operating automation across an organization.
The platform includes all the tools needed to implement enterprise-wide automation. It enables cluster and network
operations administrators to automate deployment of functional components across hybrid cloud.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management*] for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with
built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and
enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations*] is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds. Its used for persistent storage across  clusters across hybrid cloud.

The OSS and BSS portfolio architecture is based the following design principles:

*Layered solution*: The solution separates OSS and BSS applications from a common platform (enterprise-grade Kubernetes-based application platform) and infrastructure (on-premises private cloud and hyperscalers). This approach captures OSS/BSS value within the application layer enriched by the platform and powered by infrastructure.

*Break down and build up*: OSS/BSS functions are implemented in an atomic fashion (such as fault management, performance management, alert management, and accounting) so that enriched and more complex value-added services can be built using these as constructs (such as service assurance, revenue assurance, mediation, and AI/ML-driven operations).

*Self-organized autonomous systems*: Self-aware and self-scaling complete OSS/BSS solutions, from infrastructure to platform to OSS/BSS application set, are integral to the design.

*Layered solution*
This solution recommends creating an abstracted, layered approach based on these application-set placement locations:
Core: This is where the OSS/BSS solution core is deployed, leveraging on-demand high availability with a low-cost cloud multiregion, multizone infrastructure. The network fabric design part of the solution blueprint is architected to avoid well-known networking drawbacks (such as latency or replication durations). Using integrated cloud-native networking constructs and facilities (for example, unicast IPs, geoload balancers), the solution delivers the best experience with on-demand autoscaling when and where needed.
Edge: This layer covers OSS/BSS solution extensions (such as element management systems [EMS], distributed API gateways, or data ingest proxies), benefiting from hyperscaler edge (local zones) as a proximity-based availability and nearby bursting option.
Far edge: This layer operates on ingress data and interacts with the 5G/OSS/BSS solution core and on-premises low-latency solutions. This is where applications, probes, and agents are located, such as xAPPs (software tools used by the RAN intelligent controller, or RIC, to manage network functions in real time) and rAPPs (which manage non-real-time events within the RIC).
Device edge: Similar to the far edge layer, this layer deals with interaction and interworking with edge components, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, manufacturing facilities, and other network subscribers, ingressing data from these devices towards the OSS/BSS core.

*Break down and build-up*
To address the challenges with distributed and complex OSS/BSS solutions, we have applied some of the best practices from 5G core deployments and operations (distributed microservices with higher levels of automation and standards guidance). The result is a consistent model across different layers of an end-to-end 5G solution.
Within the 5G solution, each OSS and BSS microservice can either be integrated with a 5G core service over Kubernetes service exposure or implement an abstraction layer via an element management system (EMS, shown in Figure 4) and perform functional and logical breakdown underneath. Such an abstraction layer reduces integration points and network traffic complexity for OSS and BSS deployment and management and enables a single data governance point.

*Self-organized autonomous systems*
As organizations deploy more applications across multiple clouds, new operational and business challenges arise.
GitOps helps manage such complex operational scenarios. GitOps is a means of accelerating and simplifying application deployments, infrastructure management, and overall operations tasks using Git version control as your system's "source of truth" and using Git pull requests to manage, automate, and track changes.
Abilities like multicluster management, end-to-end secure software pipelines, and extendable automation platforms provide a solid foundation for applying GitOps-style workflows to various use cases within the OSS/BSS service provider application framework. Using Git-based business operations, you can declaratively manage supply chain security, cluster lifecycle management and compliance, policy management, application delivery on edge, AI/ML workload through MLOps, and more.
