Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied
where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a
small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele.

*Use case:* Streamlining integration between different elements of a retail supply chain for on-premise, cloud, and other third-party interactions.

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:

*Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

*Red Hat Integration* is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and
data across hybrid infrastructures.

*Red Hat AMQ Streams* is a massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on
the Apache Kafka project. It offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share
data with high throughput and low latency.

*Red Hat 3scale API Management* makes it easy to manage your APIs. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize
your APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

*Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

Access to the supply chain is via devices and applications used by suppliers, vendors, warehouse inventory, and order management. They are channeled through API management and generate an event stream that triggers any number of supply chain services to achieve the updates needed. These messages might need transforming before they can continue
onwards through integration or data integration services to backend systems. In this diagram several external platforms are show being leveraged by this retail organization; an AI/ML platform and a generic placeholder for any third-party
supply chain systems of record.
