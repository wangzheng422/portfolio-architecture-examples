_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Modernize the way applications are deployed and run, using microservices and serverless technologies among others as well as adopting DevOps philosophy, not having to take care of the underlying infrastructure or the platform for the applications while prioritizing security

*Background* More and more customers are adopting cloud native development technologies and embracing DevOps philosophy and culture but maintaining a container platform to do that requires a strong investment on infrastructure and a very specialized team of administrators. Both things can constitute an important overhead and create reluctance in customers to adopt container platforms

== Solution overview
The Red Hat Openshift Service on AWS Implementation architecture tackles the challenge of having a highly secured cloud native application development platform but without having to mangae it.

====
*Red Hat Openshift Service on AWS Implementation*

. Develop new applications faster, in a more flexible way  and with less footprint
. Improve customer experience and satisfaction being more responsive to market demands adopting DevOps methodologies
. Reduce the cost of having a permanent dedicated on-premise infrastructure for the container platform as well as the cost and need for skills to manage it

== The technology


The following technology was chosen for this solution:

https://aws.amazon.com/[*Amazon Web Services Cloud*] is the hyperscaler platform on which the implementation of this solution has been based. In this solution, some of the main services of the cloud platform that interact with the OpenShift clusters are highlighted, like the AWS Container Registry and the AWS Identity and Access Management for certificate management.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/aws?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS*] is a service on AWS cloud that allows to deploy fully managed OpenShift clusters which provide a Kubernetes container platform. It provides the same functionalities as regular Red Hat Openshift. The support is provided jointly by AWS and Red Hat as well as the maintenance operations to keep it up to date and compliant with both AWS and Red Hat's recommendations.

== Architectures
=== AWS ROSA public cluster

In the diagram we can see the best practices to deploy a public facing ROSA cluster.

It shows how the users and the Site Reliability Engineers can access the cluster.


=== AWS ROSA private cluster

--

This is the recommended implementation for a production cluster, being private and not exposed to Internet.

We can also see how the SREs and the customers connect to the cluster in a secure way.
