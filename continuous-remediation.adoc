This architecture covers Continuous Remediation of Red Hat server hosts or hybrid cloud hosts. Modern application
infrastructure has, in many ways, gotten more complex as it has gotten more powerful and easy to consume. Keeping that
infrastructure safe and compliant is a challenge for many organizations. One of the most powerful tools in infrastructure management
today is the combination of using insights based on historical data, and automation tools for applying remediation across hundreds
or thousands of hosts in a targeted and prioritized manner. 

*Use case:* Managing security, policy and patches for a large number of servers in data centers or public/private clouds.
