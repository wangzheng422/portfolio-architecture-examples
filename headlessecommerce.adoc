Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to
earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied
where a service provider fills the small orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a
small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele.

*Use case:* Deploying a container based eCommerce website while moving away from tightly coupled existing eCommerce
platform.

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Runtimes* helps organizations use the cloud delivery model and simplify continuous delivery of
applications, the cloud-native way. Built on proven open source technologies, it also provides development teams
multiple modernization options to enable a smooth transition to the cloud for existing applications.

** *Red Hat Integration* is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and
data across hybrid infrastructures.

** *Red Hat AMQ Streams* is a massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on
the Apache Kafka project. It offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share
data with high throughput and low latency.

** *Red Hat 3scale API Management* makes it easy to manage your APIs. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize
your APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds.

** *Red Hat Ceph Storage* is an open, massively scalable, simplified storage solution for modern data pipelines.
Engineered for data analytics, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), and emerging workloads, it delivers
software-defined storage on your choice of industry-standard hardware.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

The developer is central to delivering the components used in this architecture. The developer IDE is the tooling the
developer codes in. A source code management repository is used in some form. For this a Git-based repository was used.
Integration is based on Camel, Fuse, and often a collection of Java runtimes. All the work is done using local
container tooling and triggers builds with git hooks, maven plugins, or file uploads.

A container platform hosting the continuous integration (CI) and continuous development (CD) tooling is the main
element in the dev infrastructure. The SCM repository represents the connection between developer nd collecting project
artifacts for use in the container CI/CD platform for testing , tagging, and finalising of images for the image
management to process out into the test infrastructure.

The test environment is used to roll out the entire headless e-commerce suite of services, web application, and
messaging. These are tied to external integration services and the testing web application. The process continues on
through more environments until the organisation is satisfied to push to production, which is not shown in this diagram
due to space.

Integration is based on Camel, Fuse, and often a collection of Java runtimes. All the work is done using remote
container tooling and triggers builds with git hooks, maven plugins, or OpenShift client tooling.

A container platform hosting the continuous integration (CI) and continuous development (CD) tooling is the main
element in the dev infrastructure. The SCM repository represents the connection between developer nd collecting project
artifacts for use in the container CI/CD platform for testing , tagging, and finalising of images for the image
management to process out into the test infrastructure. A source-to-image process is triggered by the remote tooling
and the code it pulled into a container build process, which is then pushed into the CI/CD testing for eventual tagging.
Once tagged it is placed in the container platform registry which rolls out a dev environment of the headless
e-commerce for developer testing. Once satisfied, it's tagged for test, the next step.

The image is pushed to the test environment and rolls out the entire headless e-commerce suite of services, web
application, and messaging. These are tied to external integration services and the testing web application. The
process continues on through more environments until the organisation is satisfied to push to production, which is
not shown in this diagram due to space.
