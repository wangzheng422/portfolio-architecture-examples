This is a collection of various architectures in the retail domain. Retail is the process of selling consumer
goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Retailers satisfy demand
identified through a supply chain. The term "retailer" is typically applied where a service provider fills the small
orders of many individuals, who are end-users, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or
government clientele.
