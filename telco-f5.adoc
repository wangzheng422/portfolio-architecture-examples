_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all Red Hat architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

== Use case

Delivering Next Cloud-native network function (CNF) Solution with F5 Big-IP

== Background

5G networks using a service-based architecture (SBA) and cloud-native approach offers many advantages to service providers including agility, scalability, and reduced Capex/Opex. Cloud-native network functions (CNFs) have become the main delivery mechanism of 5G network services. As an evolution from virtual network functions (VNFs), cloud-native network functions (CNFs) are designed and implemented to run inside containers. This containerization of network architecture components makes it possible to run a variety of services on the same cluster and more easily on-board already decomposed applications, while dynamically directing network traffic to the correct pods.


== Solution overview

This architecture extends the other 5G Core portfolio architectures with Next CNF Solution with F5 Big-IP. In addition to Red Hat components, this solution includes:

- F5 Next Edge Firewall CNF is an IPv4/IPv6 firewall for protecting the 5G core networks from external threads, including DDoS flood protection and IPS protocol inspection.
- F5 Next CGNAT CNF offers large scale NAT44 & NAT64 including Application Layer Gateway (ALG) support.
- F5 Next DNS CNF provides a transparent DNS resolver and caching services.
- F5 Next Policy Enforcer CNF provides Traffic classification, steering & shaping, TCP and Video optimization.


====
The business drivers for the Telco Next CNF Solution with F5 include:

. Kubernetes-orchestrated CNFs allow for a common, consistent control plane which provides for simplified operation and automation
. Re-architecture of VNFs into microservices allows for better utilization of resources, faster deployment, and better scalability
. Required functionality for subscribers in the N6 LAN/Gi LAN reference point

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] is a unified platform to quickly build, modernize, and deploy both traditional and cloud-native applications at scale. It is packaged with a complete set of services for bringing apps to market on your choice of infrastructure. It’s based on an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, public cloud, and edge deployments.  https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/ocp-self-managed-trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] provides an enterprise framework for building and operating IT automation at scale across hybrid clouds including edge deployments. It enables users across an organization to create, share, and manage automation—-from development and operations to security and network teams. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management*] for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with
built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and
enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Quay*] is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images. Its used to store
container image repositories for platform and application images, DevOps or GitOps pipelines, and automation tools for
deployment across various clusters. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://access.redhat.com/products/identity-management?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Identity Management*] provides a centralized and unified way to manage identity stores, authentication,
policies, and authorization policies in a Linux-based domain. This is part of the common datacenter services applicable
to network applications running on cloud platforms.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation*] is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds. It's used for persistent storage across multiple clusters. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/data-foundation/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]
