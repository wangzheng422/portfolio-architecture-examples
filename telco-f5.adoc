_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

*Use case:* Delivering Next CNF Solution with F5 Big-IP
*Background:* Deploying cloud-native 5G with a unified data plane shared across CNFs can greatly reduce overhead, latency and minimize networking connectivity requirements.


== Solution overview

This portfolio architecture extends the other 5G Core portfolio architectures with Next CNF Solution with F5 Big-IP. In addition to Red Hat components, this solution includes:

- F5 Next Edge Firewall CNF is an IPv4/IPv6 firewall for protecting the 5G core networks from external threads, including DDoS flood protection and IPS protocol inspection.
- F5 Next CGNAT CNF offers large scale NAT44 & NAT64 including ALG support.
- F5 Next DNS CNF provides a transparent DNS resolver and caching services. Other remarkable features are:
Zero rating
DNS64
- F5 Next Policy Enforcer CNF provides Traffic classification, steering & shaping, TCP and Video optimization.

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
OpenShift enables 5GC by supporting functionalities and operational features like automated deployment, intelligent
workload placement, dynamic scaling, hitless upgrades, and self healing.

https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/5ef20efd46bc301a95a1e9a4?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat AMQ Streams*] is a massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on
the Apache Kafka project. AMQ Streams enables exchange of telemetry and control/management data with back end and
operational systems.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] is a foundation for building and operating automation across an organization.
The platform includes all the tools needed to implement enterprise-wide automation. It enables cluster and network
operations administrators to automate deployment of functional components.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management*] for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with
built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and
enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Quay*] is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images. Its used to store
container image repositories for platform and application images, DevOps or GitOps pipelines, and automation tools for
deployment across various clusters.


https://access.redhat.com/products/identity-management?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Identity Management*] provides a centralized and unified way to manage identity stores, authentication,
policies, and authorization policies in a Linux-based domain. This is part of the common datacenter services applicable
to network applications running on cloud platforms.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations*] is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds. Its used for persistent storage across multiple clusters.

Conceptually, the 5G core N6 solution stack can be categorized into:

* *Individual cluster components*

* *Shared cluster platform services*

* *External services*

* *External network infrastructure*

* *Management and orchestration*
