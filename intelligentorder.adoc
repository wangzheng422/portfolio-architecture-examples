== Use cases

Intelligent order with an emphasis on last mile delivery:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Business scenario |Challenge
|Consumers are purchasing more products online |Online purchases of
goods and direct-to-consumer deliveries are increasing dramatically. 
This has driven huge increases in the volume and importance of last
mile delivery and installation services.

|Consumers are placing more emphasis on post-sale services |Consumers
are demanding more control over delivery times and processes and want
more value-added services. Manufacturers and suppliers are not meeting
expectations, especially with respect to last mile services.

|New service providers are entering the market and reshaping the landscape
|New entrants to 3PL (third party logistics) services such as Amazon and
Uber are disrupting traditional service models.  Same day delivery is
now often an expectation. This increases infrastructure and transportation
services cost. Improved supply and demand forecasting is key to
delivering last mile services.

|Logistics costs are increasing, while product prices are eroding
|Manufacturers are forced to react quickly to changing customer demands
while managing rising costs. Costs for warehousing, transportation, and
labor are increasing. This increases pressure on intelligent order
performance for both profitability and customer loyalty.

== Background

In the context of supply chain optimization, intelligent order refers to the use of advanced algorithms and techniques to determine the optimal order quantity, timing, and placement for each product within the supply chain network. This involves analyzing various factors, such as demand patterns, lead times, production and transportation costs, inventory levels, and customer service levels, to make data-driven decisions that maximize efficiency and profitability.

One particular aspect of intelligent order on which this portfolio architecture focuses is using inventory management systems and machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) to provide effective last mile delivery.

Last mile delivery, also known as last mile logistics, refers to the final leg of the delivery process, whereby goods are transported from a local hub or distribution center to the customer's doorstep or preferred delivery location. It is the most crucial and expensive part of the delivery process, as it typically involves the use of smaller vehicles to navigate through crowded urban areas and deliver goods to individual customers.

Last mile delivery is often considered a primary bottleneck of the supply chain, as it involves complex logistical challenges such as traffic congestion, unpredictable delivery locations, and varying customer demands (such as installation of large or bulky items). Yet, it remains a critical area of focus for businesses seeking to optimize their supply chain operations and meet the evolving demands of today's consumers especially in light of the increase in deliveries direct to consumers. It can be a tricky balancing act between meeting consumer (and business) expectations and optimizing for low delivery costs.


=== Business problem

By definition, last mile delivery is relevant for businesses that
deliver products directly to their consumers.

If a product arrives late,
is damaged, lacks correct and current tracking information, or is never delivered, there’s a good chance that the
customer will shop with a competitor next time.

Customers want:

* Fast delivery
* Delivery tracking
* Security
* Convenience
* Specialization
* Ability to select delivery based on cost or other requirements

Business need to consider:

* Fuel costs
* Idling and downtime
* Warehousing
* Failed deliveries
* Returns
* Sustainability commitments

https://www.ibm.com/products/intelligent-promising[Key metrics]:

* 47.6% of shoppers will shop elsewhere if they cannot see inventory
availability before they buy
* 49% of shoppers would cancel their cart due to mismatch between
expectations for delivery date and actual delivery date
* 58% of shoppers report checking inventory availability in the last 6
months

|Business Problem |Solution
|Maximize inventory productivity |Use real-time inventory visibility to
confidently expose inventory and maximize conversions, and gain granular
control over inventory actions, such as safety stock settings based on
configurable business rules. Improve inventory turns by applying
additional context like channel, fulfillment type, and labor availability
when making available-to promise decisions.

|Make and manage order promises |Improve conversion rates by confidently
delivering order and delivery promises across every step of the shopping
journey, including the product list page, product detail page, cart, and
checkout. Automate the review of inventory, capacity, and costs to make
informed promises, harness powerful AI during fulfillment to
simplify complex scenarios (such as orders with third-party services), and
support a wide range of fulfillment options.

|Customers don't know where their order went |Proof of delivery (POD) is an acknowledgment that an order
successfully arrived at its intended destination and is used to show a
service was completed, which is why proof of delivery is also called
proof of completion. It can be in paper or
electronic form. POD and tracking improve the customer experience and make package theft and confusion about delivery location less likely.

|Optimize omni-channel profitability |Set operating performance
objectives and KPIs using real cost drivers (like distance, labor,
capacity, and carrier costs) and profit drivers (like markdown and stockout), so
you can confidently make the best fulfillment decisions for your
business objectives. By optimizing across thousands of fulfillment
permutations in milliseconds, retailers can ensure balance between
profitability and the best customer experience.

== Solution overview

The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into
three main categories as shown in Figure 1:

* Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such
as order management, facilities management. These systems can be
stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases.
* Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red
Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed
through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.
* Fulfillment optimization
* Intelligent promising

_Figure 3. Overall schematic of intelligent order use case of supply chain optimization._

The steps in this workflow are as follows:

It begins with a customer placing or otherwise interacting with an order through the omni-channel. Omni-channel refers to the integration of all channels and touchpoints that a retailer uses to interact with its customers, whether it is in-store, online, through mobile devices, social media, or any other means. 

After the order is placed, inventory fulfillment and delivery tracking information is delivered from the supply assurance platform; the backend systems are accessed via API Management and Integration Services. The Inventory Management System checks with the Store Operations System to see if the inventory is available in the store; If the store cannot fulfill order, then check with the Warehouse Management System to see where inventory is available.

Once the ordered items are found, update the Transport/Logistics System to schedule delivery, then cross-check with the Fulfillment System to schedule and track the order. Maintain real-time tracking of the order throughout the process and upon delivery provide proof-of-delivery (electronic or paper).

== Action Guide

From a high-level perspective, there are several main steps your
organization can take to drive innovation and move toward a digital
supply chain:

* Automation
* Sustainability
* Modernization
