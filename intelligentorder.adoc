== Intelligent order

_Last mile delivery_, also known as _last mile logistics_, is the
transportation of goods from a distribution hub to the final delivery
destination — the door of the customer. The goal of last mile delivery
logistics is to deliver the packages as affordably, quickly and
accurately as possible. 

The last mile describes the difficulty of getting goods (especially
large and bulky ones) from a transportation hub to their final
destination because it might include installation and configuration
while providing an excellent experience at the same time.

_Intelligent order_ is a process that uses inventory management systems
and AI to provide effective last mile delivery.

For businesses this means:

* Decrease waste
* Order optimization
* Reduced cost

Consumers benefit with:

* Delivery promises fulfilled
* Proof of delivery

=== Business problem

If the last mile promise to delivery is incorrect and a product arrives
late, there’s a good chance that the customer will shop with a
competitor next time.

If last mile tracking information is incorrect, a product arrives late,
is damaged, or is never delivered, there’s a good chance that the
customer will shop with a competitor next time.

Customers want:

* Fast delivery
* Delivery tracking
* Security
* Convenience
* Specialization
* Selection delivery based on cost

Business need to consider:

* Fuel costs
* Idling and downtime
* Warehousing
* Failed deliveries
* Returns
* Sustainability commitments

Key metrics:

* 47.6% of shoppers will shop elsewhere if they cannot see inventory
availability before they buy
* 49% of shoppers would cancel their cart due to mismatch between
expectations for delivery date and actual delivery date
* 58% of shoppers report checking inventory availability in the last 6
months

mile delivery landscape in the grocery sector]:

* Shifting tactics – evolving channel strategies and business models
* Need convenience delivered – customer’s new mantra
* Future of Last Mile increasingly a story of better software and
connectivity

=== Use cases

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Business scenario |Challenge
|Consumers are purchasing more products online |Online purchases of
goods and direct to consumer deliveries are increasing dramatically. 
This has driven huge increases in the volume  and importance of last
mile delivery and installation services.

|Consumers are placing more emphasis on after sales services |Consumers
are demanding more control over delivery times and processes and want
more value-added services. Manufacturers and suppliers are not meeting
expectations, especially with last mile services.

|New service providers are entering the market; reshaping the landscape
|New entrants to 3PL (third party logistics) services such as Amazon and
Uber are disrupting traditional service models.  Same day delivery is
now an expectation, and this increases infrastructure and transportation
services cost. Improved supply and demand forecasting is key to
delivering last mile services.

|Logistics costs are increasing, while product prices are eroding
|Manufacturers are forced to react quickly to changing client demands
while managing rising costs. Costs for warehousing, transportation and
labor are increasing and this increases pressure on perfect order
performance for both profitability and client loyalty.

==== Proof of Delivery

Proof of delivery, or POD, is an acknowledgment that an order
successfully arrived at its intended destination and is used to show a
service was completed, which is why proof of delivery is also called
proof of completion. Proof of delivery comes in two forms: paper and
electronic. Benefits of POD are captured in the table.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Benefits for customers |Benefits for businesses
|Customers in control |Promise of delivery provides a better customer
experience

|Proof of Delivery makes it less likely orders will be stolen |Improves
order accuracy and saves money on unnecessary refunds or replacements

|Lets customers know their service is complete |POD automation
accelerates back-office operations

=== Challenges / Business Drivers

*Challenges*

* Consumer demand for delivery as promised
* Consumers wanting control of delivery and return processes
* Logistics costs in providing last mile delivery
* Logistics ecosystem complexity

*Drivers*

* Increasing deliveries direct to consumer
* Need for delivery price-point optimization and improvement
* Customer satisfaction to drive repeat business

=== Responses

By definition, last mile delivery is relevant for businesses that
deliver products directly to their consumers.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Business Problem |Solution
|Maximize inventory productivity |Use real-time inventory visibility to
confidently expose inventory and maximize conversions, gaining granular
control over inventory actions, such as safety stock setting based on
configurable business rules. Improve inventory turns by applying
additional context like channel, fulfillment type and labor availability
when making available-to promise decisions.

|Make and manage order promises |Improve conversion rates by confidently
delivering order and delivery promises across every step of the shopping
journey, including the product list page, product detail page, cart, and
checkout. Automate the review of inventory, capacity and costs to make
informed promises, and harness powerful AI during fulfillment to
simplify complex scenarios like orders with third-party services, and
support a wide range of fulfillment options.

|Optimize omnichannel profitability |Set operating performance
objectives and KPIs using real cost drivers (like distance, labor,
capacity, and carrier costs) and profit drivers markdown, stockout), so
you can confidently make the best fulfillment decisions for your
business objectives. By optimizing across thousands of fulfillment
permutations in milliseconds, retailers can ensure balance between
profitability and the best customer experience.

=== Business outcomes

* *Decrease waste*. Decrease order fragmentation and waste with decrease
in packages per order.
* *Order optimization*. In-stock improvement through holiday season
using Order Optimizer.
* *Reduce costs*. Reduced costs and emissions by housing software on the
cloud more efficiently than on-premises
* *Minimize disruption*. Gain visibility to minimize disruption to
business despite supply and demand shocks
* *Returns optimization*. Returns refurbished to create a revenue stream

=== Solution overview

This solution focuses on _Automation_ and _Modernization_ in our Action
Guide as shown in the following diagram:

* Create a world-class sensing and risk-monitoring operation.
* Accelerate automation in extended workflows
* Amp up AI to make workflows smarter
* Modernize for modern infrastructures, scale hybrid cloud platforms

image::./images/intro-marketectures/intelligentorder-marketing-slide.png[solution overview]

The solution uses the following technologies, which can be grouped into
three main categories as shown in the following diagram:

* Core application systems. Often customer-provided technologies, such
as order management, facilities management. These systems can be
stand-alone applications, on premises and cloud services, databases.
* Foundational infrastructure. The Red Hat/IBM solution is built on Red
Hat OpenShift. Data is routed through API management. Events are routed
through Business Automation tools such as Business Automation Workshop.
* Fulfillment optimization
* Intelligent promising

=== Intelligent order

The following diagram shows the schematic for the intelligent order use
case.

image::./images/schematic-diagrams/intelligentorder-sd.png[last mile delivery schematic]

Intelligent order steps:

Customer places/track/confirm order thru omni channel 

Inventory fulfilment, and delivery tracking information is quicky
obtained from supply assurance Platform

Access underlying backend system via API Management

Integration services

Check with the Store Operations System if inventory available in store

If store cannot fulfill order, check with Warehouse Management System
where inventory is available

Update Transport/Logistics System to schedule delivery

Cross check with the Fulfilment System to schedule and track the order

Provide real-time tracking of the order and upon delivery provide POD
(electronic or paper)
