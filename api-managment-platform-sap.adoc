== The technology
The following technology was chosen for this solution:

*Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions* is combining an intelligent operating system with predictive management
tools and SAP-specific content, Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions provides a single, consistent, highly
available foundation for business-critical SAP and non-SAP workloads.

*Red Hat Satellite* the smart management element in this architecture, used for tracking, managing, auditing, and
collecting data on the entire infrastructure to ensure that baselines are met.

*Red Hat Smart Management*, which includes Satellite and Cloud Connector, provides the capability to gather
anonymized configuration information from the SAP hosts and send that anonymized data to Insights Platform (on Red
Hat’s SaaS). Satellite manages the lifecycle of the SAP servers, applying the packages, security fixes, etc., that
they need to be compliant with SAP’s and Red Hat’s recommendations and consistent between them.

*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform* is the framework used in this solution to run the remediation Ansible
playbooks in the hosts that will correct the situations that could lead to a failure or issue, for example modifying
a kernel memory parameter that can cause a bad performance of the SAP HANA DB or applying a certain level of an OS
package that is needed for a particular version of SAP Netweaver.
