_Updated November 2023._

_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

== Use case

Provide remote management so that a server environment is consistent, secure, and has associated data protected across a hybrid cloud and data centers for its full lifecycle.

== Background

As more and more enterprises deploy across different data centers, public and/or private clouds, and edge locations, it is important to maintain consistency and security in an automated way across all of the servers in order to reduce risk and costs. Remote server management can also help to improve uptime by helping IT staff to quickly identify and resolve problems, while cloud services can provide valuable insights that can help optimize and secure the entire environment.


== Solution overview

Figure 1 provides an overview of the major components in a cloud or data center together with the components doing the remote management. These provide:

* Consistency of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) environment across ublic clouds and data centers
* Full lifecycle management
* Remote management and automation

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*]  is a unified platform to quickly build, modernize, and deploy both traditional and cloud-native applications at scale. It is packaged with a complete set of services for bringing apps to market on your choice of infrastructure. It’s based on an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy. It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, public cloud, and edge deployments. Red Hat OpenShift supplies tools needed for DevOps, an approach to culture, automation, and platform design intended to deliver increased business value and responsiveness through rapid, high-quality service delivery. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/ocp-self-managed-trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform*] provides a framework for building and operating IT automation at scale across hybrid clouds including edge deployments. It enables users across an organization to create, share, and manage automation—from development and operations to security and network teams. The platform includes all the tools needed to implement enterprise-wide automation. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Insights*] continuously analyzes platforms and applications to predict risk, recommend actions, and track costs so enterprises can better manage hybrid cloud environments.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Data Foundation*] is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications quickly and efficiently across clouds. Red Hat Data Foundation integrates a collection of software projects, including Ceph to provide block storage, a shared and distributed file system, and on-prem object storage. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/data-foundation/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]


https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Satellite*] is an infrastructure management product specifically designed to keep Red Hat Enterprise Linux environments and other Red Hat infrastructure running efficiently, securely, and compliantly.


https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Quay*] is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images. It analyzes your images for security vulnerabilities, identifying potential issues that can help you mitigate security risks. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/quay/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]


https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux*] is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system (OS) that’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal, virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments. https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/server/trial?intcmp=7013a000003Sh3TAAS[*Try It >*]



== Architectures

Figures 3 and 4 provide a schematic view of the remote server management solution from network- and data-centric perspectives respectively. The two diagrams are summarized below.

_Figure 4. Schematic diagram of the remote server management solution from a data-centric perspective._

The architecture is designed to automate the deployment and management of servers, no matter their location in your chosen cloud architecture. The core data center is where an organization’s images are built and deployed to the image store found in the core data center. It’s also where the application source code resides in a source code management system (SCM).

Infrastructure management uses automation orchestration together with Red Hat Satellite to automate the delivery of images to the desired cloud infrastructure destinations (physical data center, private cloud, or public cloud). There the Red Hat OpenShift platform ensures the images are deployed for use. Note that these diagrams also feature edge or remote deployments; through the use of automation orchestration the edge applications and edge devices are managed alongside the rest of the cloud infrastructure.

Cloud services from Red Hat provide centralized automation analytics, insights into the core services across the deployed cloud architecture, and management insights used to maintain the catalog of activities automating the management of all remote infrastructure.
