_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._

== Use case 
Financial institutions want to enable customers to use fast, easy to use, and secure payment services available anytime, anywhere.


== Background
An offering of (near) real-time payments allows businesses, consumers, and governments to send and accept funds that provide both availability to the recipient and instant confirmation to the sender. Enabling real-time payments improves the speed of the online payment experiences to customers and gives banks a greater opportunity to win, serve, and retain their customers. By building solutions that capture real-time payment business, banks also can drive higher payment volumes, ideally at lower costs—in addition to engaging with new customer segments.

Real-time payments give customers the convenience of knowing that their payments will be received instantly, regardless of the time of day or day of the week. This can be especially important for businesses that need to make or receive payments quickly, such as for payroll or bill payments.

They can also help businesses improve their cash flow management by giving them more visibility into their incoming and outgoing payments. This can help them to better manage their expenses and optimize their working capital..

In addition, real-time payments can help financial institutions to comply with regulations, such as those governing anti-money laundering and know-your-customer.




== Solution overview
The architecture shown in Figure 1 covers the use case around using a modern payments architecture in the financial services domain. Built on a container platform, it provides improved transparency into near-real-time account balances, better fraud monitoring, and timely payments data for use with analytics.

== Logical diagram

The modern payments architecture logical diagram in Figure 2 shows the major functional blocks of the solution. The core functionality is in the container platform which also includes integration and other microservices, API management, and single-sign-on functionality. The container platform interfaces with external applications and services as well as the underlying hybrid cloud infrastructure and infrastructure services such as event streaming.

Here, it communicates between the event sources, all of the microservices that handle the events, and the automation layer that performs the final remediation, including results listening and response. AMQ provides efficient queuing and event streaming for seamless data exchange between applications and microservices, with extremely high throughput, and extremely low latency. Red Hat AMQ is also included as part of Red Hat Application Foundations.

== Architectures

The schematic diagrams In Figures 3 through 7 provide detail about immediate payments (from both network- and data-centric perspectives), anti-money laundering, fraud detection, and financial calculations.


=== Immediate payments

_Figure 4. Schematic diagram of modern payments architecture solution with a focus on data associated with immediate payments._

The immediate payments workflow shown in Figures 3 and 4 starts with a payment request coming through the front-facing payments API, which is then validated and used to trigger an event in the payments event stream. At this point, we assume that all the checks are triggered—which is not always the case—so that we can describe all of the detailed architectural elements in this diagram. 

From the events stream both anti-money laundering and fraud detection services—described in more detail below—are used to ensure this is a valid payment request and not a mistake or something malicious. If those checks clear, an event triggers processing the payment. Routing services subsequently send the final payment instructions to the external payments network. Figure 3 focuses on the network architecture and Figure 4 on the data flow.


=== Anti-money laundering (AML)

_Figure 5. Schematic diagram of modern payments architecture solution with a focus on anti-money laundering._


Figure 5 zooms into the anti-money laundering element of the architecture. The payments API is left out of the diagram to more clearly focus on event streaming and anti-money laundering activities. 

The events stream triggers the start of an anti-money laundering check, which involves taking a look at the payment transaction to score it and add labels as needed. 

These scoring and labeling decisions are based on the use of an AI/ML model that is shown in the bottom right of Figure 5 being updated and trained using know-your-customer (KYC) data maintained in external systems at a financial institution. Once the sourcing is done,rules ensure that the payment is not transgressing any anti-money laundering rules. If it is a good payment request, that event is sent back to the event stream for processing through to payment as described in Figures 3 and 4. A rule is apparently violated, an event is sent to the malicious activity streams element so that a case can be opened for further investigation and suspicious activity processes initiated.


=== Fraud detection
--

--

_Figure 6. Schematic diagram of modern payments architecture solution with a focus on fraud detection._

Figure 6 looks at the fraud detection element in more detail. As before, it leaves out the payments API to focus on event streaming and, in this case, the fraud detection activities. 

We see that the events stream triggers the start of a fraud detection check, which scores and adds labels to the payment transaction as needed. As with anti-money laundering detection, scoring and labeling decisions are based on the use of the AI/ML model that is shown in the bottom right being updated, which is trained using KYC data maintained in external systems at a financial institution. 

Once the sourcing is complete, rules are used to ensure that the payment is not transgressing any fraud rules. If it is a good payment request, that event is sent back to the event stream for processing through to payment as described previously. If potential fraud is detected, an event is sent to the malicious activity streams element so that a fraud prevention process starts. The eventual outcome of this process is delivered back to the event streams for processing only if the detection was determined to be in error (a false positive).


=== Financial calculations

--

_Figure 7. Schematic diagram of modern payments architecture solution with a focus on financial calculations._

The financial calculations diagram in Figure 7 lays out an architecture that is in the payments realm, but is primarily intended to determine the payment to be requested through a billing system of a customer. 
The request for calculating a payment comes into the architecture in the form of a message from the front-facing API’s. This message is processed through various message queues, first to validate the request, then to process it through detailed calculations using rule services to determine the payment needed. Integration services connect the organization to the billing systems that issue the payment invoice.
