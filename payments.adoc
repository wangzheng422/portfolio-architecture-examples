This architecture covers the use case around using payments architecture in the financial services domain. An offering
of (near) real-time payments lets businesses, consumers, and even governments send and accept funds that provide both
availability to the recipient and instant confirmation to the sender. Enabling real-time - or at least faster - payments
that improve the speed of online payment experiences to customers has the potential to give banks a greater opportunity
to win, serve, and retain their customers. By building solutions that capture real-time payment business, banks also
can drive higher payment volumes, ideally at lower costs as well as engage new customer segments.

*Use case:* Financial institutions enabling customers with fast, easy to use, and safe payment services available
anytime, anywhere.

== The technology
--

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat OpenShift* is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an open hybrid cloud strategy.
It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Runtimes* helps organizations use the cloud delivery model and simplify continuous delivery of applications, the cloud-native way. Built on proven open source technologies, it also provides development teams multiple modernization options to enable a smooth transition to the cloud for existing applications.

** *Red Hat 3scale API Management* makes it easy to manage your APIs. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize your APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

** *Red Hat AMQ Streams* is a massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on the Apache Kafka project. It offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share data with high throughput and low latency.

** *Red Hat Business Automation* is an application development platform that enables developers and business experts to create cloud-native applications that automate business operations.

** *Red Hat Integration* is a comprehensive set of integration and messaging technologies to connect applications and data across hybrid infrastructures.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* is software-defined storage for containers. Engineered as the data and storage
services platform for Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation helps teams develop and deploy applications
quickly and efficiently across clouds.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

== Immediate payments

The overview of immediate payments starts with a payment request through the front facing payments API, which is then
validated, then used to trigger an event in the payments event stream. At this point we assume that all the checks
are triggered, which is not always the case, so that we can describe all of the detailed architectural elements in
this diagram. From the events stream both anti-money laundering and fraud detection services are used to ensure this
is a valid payment request and not something negligent. If they clear those checks, an event triggers the clearning
of the payment to process it through those services before routing services are event triggered to send the final
payment instructions ot the external payments network. The first diagram is of a network based architecture and the
second focuses on the data flow.

== Anti-money laundering (AML)
--
image:schematic-diagrams/fsi-payments-anti-money-laundering-sd.png[350,300]
--

This example zooms into the first diagram, looking at the anti-money laundering element in more detail. For this reason
the payments API is left out of the diagram for focus on event streaming and the anti-money laundering activities in
this architecture. We see that the events stream triggers the start of an anti-money laundering check, which is taking
a look at the payment transaction to score it and add labels as needed. These are scoring and labelling decisions are
based on the use of a AI/ML model that is shown in the bottom right being updated and trained using know your customer
data maintained in external systems at a financial institution. Once the sorcing is done, rules are used to ensure that
the payment is not transgressing any anti-money laundering rules. If it is a good payment request, that event is sent
back to the event stream for processing through to payment as described in the previous diagrams. If bad intent
is detected, an event is sent the to malicious activity streams element so that a case can be opened for further
investigation and suspicious activity processes can be started to report the final outcomes.

== Fraud detection

This example zooms into the first diagram, looking at the fraud detection element in more detail. For this reason
the payments API is left out of the diagram for focus on event streaming and the fraud detection activities in
this architecture. We see that the events stream triggers the start of a fraud detection check, which is taking

based on the use of a AI/ML model that is shown in the bottom right being updated and trained using know your customer
data maintained in external systems at a financial institution. Once the sorcing is done, rules are used to ensure that
the payment is not transgressing any fraud rules. If it is a good payment request, that event is sent
back to the event stream for processing through to payment as described in the previous diagrams. If potential fraud
was detected, an event is sent the to malicious activity streams element so that a fraud prevention process starts. The
eventual outcome of this process is delivered back to the event steams for processing only if the detection was
determined to be wrong.

== Financial calculations
--

The financial calculations diagram lays our an architecture that is in the payments realm, but more designed to
determine the payment to be requested through a billing system of a customer. The request for calculating a payment
comes into the architecture in the form of a message from the front facing API's. This message is processed through
various message queues, first validation of the request, then processed through detailed calculations using rule based
validation to determine the payment needed, through integration services connecting the organisation to their eventual
billing systems to issue the payment invoice.
