This architecture covers the use case around using payments architecture in the financial services domain. An offering of (near) real-time payments allows businesses, consumers, and governments to send and accept funds that provide both availability to the recipient and instant confirmation to the sender. Enabling real-time payments improves the speed of the online payment experiences to customers and gives banks a greater opportunity to win, serve, and retain their customers. By building solutions that capture real-time payment business, banks also can drive higher payment volumes, ideally at lower costs as well as engage new customer segments.

====
*Business driver for Payments*
. Better transparency into actual account balances
. Improved ability to monitor payments for fraud
. Generation of real-time payments data for analytics
====

*Use case:* Financial institutions enabling customers with fast, easy to use, and safe payment services available anytime, anywhere.

== Immediate payments

The overview of immediate payments starts with a payment request through the front-facing payments API, which is then validated, then used to trigger an event in the payments event stream. At this point we assume that all the checks
are triggered, which is not always the case, so that we can describe all of the detailed architectural elements in
this diagram. From the events stream both anti-money laundering and fraud detection services are used to ensure this
is a valid payment request and not something negligent. If they clear those checks, an event triggers the clearing of the payment to process it through those services before routing services are triggered to send the final payment instructions to the external payments network. The first diagram is of a network based architecture and the second focuses on the data flow.

== Anti-money laundering (AML)
--

--

This example zooms into the first diagram, looking at the anti-money laundering element in more detail. For this reason the payments API is left out of the diagram to focus on event streaming and the anti-money laundering activities in this architecture. The events stream triggers the start of an anti-money laundering check, which is taking a look at the payment transaction to score it and add labels as needed. These scoring and labeling decisions are based on the use of an AI/ML model that is shown in the bottom right being updated and trained using know your customer data maintained in external systems at a financial institution. Once the sourcing is done, rules are used to ensure that the payment is not transgressing any anti-money laundering rules. If it is a good payment request, that event is sent back to the event stream for processing through to payment as described in the previous diagrams. If bad intent is detected, an event is sent to the malicious activity streams element so that a case can be opened for further investigation and suspicious activity processes can be started to report the final outcomes.

== Fraud detection

This example zooms into the first diagram, looking at the fraud detection element in more detail. For this reason the payments API is left out of the diagram to focus on event streaming and the fraud detection activities in this architecture. We see that the events stream triggers the start of a fraud detection check, which is taking a look at the payment transaction to score it and add labels as needed. These scoring and labeling decisions are based on the use of an AI/ML model that is shown in the bottom right being updated and trained using know your customer data maintained in external systems at a financial institution. Once the sourcing is done, rules are used to ensure that the payment is not transgressing any fraud rules. If it is a good payment request, that event is sent back to the event stream for processing through to payment as described in the previous diagrams. If potential fraud was detected, an event is sent to the malicious activity streams element so that a fraud prevention process starts. The eventual outcome of this process is delivered back to the event streams for processing only if the detection was determined to be wrong.

== Financial calculations

--

The financial calculations diagram lays out an architecture that is in the payments realm, but more designed to determine the payment to be requested through a billing system of a customer. The request for calculating a payment
comes into the architecture in the form of a message from the front facing API's. This message is processed through various message queues, first validation of the request, then processed through detailed calculations using rule services to determine the payment needed, through integration services connecting the organization to their eventual billing systems to issue the payment invoice.
