_Updated July 2023_

_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._


*Use case:* Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) which focuses on the building and delivery of systems and platforms in a secure and scalable manner while meeting the data needs for increasingly consumerized healthcare.


== Background

Intelligent data as a service (IDaaS) in healthcare provides healthcare organizations with access to a variety of data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), clinical decision support (CDS) systems, and patient-generated data. This data is then processed and analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify patterns and trends that can be used to improve patient care.

There are several reasons why IDaaS is becoming increasingly important in healthcare. First, the amount of data generated by healthcare organizations is growing exponentially. IDaaS can help healthcare organizations to make sense of this vast amount of data and to identify the insights that can be used to improve patient care.

Second, AI and ML algorithms are becoming increasingly sophisticated and can now be used to analyze complex data sets. This means that IDaaS can be used to identify patterns and trends that would not be visible to human analysts. For example, IDaaS can be used to identify patients who are at risk of developing a certain disease, or to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from a particular treatment.

Third, IDaaS can help to improve the efficiency of healthcare organizations. By automating tasks such as data analysis and reporting, IDaaS can free up healthcare professionals to focus on providing patient care.

Overall, IDaaS is a powerful tool that can be used to improve patient care and the efficiency of healthcare organizations. As the amount of data generated by healthcare organizations continues to grow, IDaaS is likely to become even more important in the future.


However, it’s also important to design and modify decision-making, processes, and workflows for specific situations without becoming dependent on a single vendor. The solution presented here covers the use case around using intelligent data as a service in the healthcare industry using Red Hat technologies to implement a flexible, open approach.

== The technology

The following technology was chosen for this solution:


====
https://www.redhat.com/en/products/application-foundations?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Application Foundations*] (formerly Red Hat Integration) Includes frameworks and capabilities for designing, building, deploying, connecting, securing, and scaling cloud-native applications, including foundational patterns like microservices, API-first, and data streaming. When combined with Red Hat OpenShift, Application Foundations creates a hybrid cloud platform for development and operations teams to build and modernize applications efficiently and with attention to security, while balancing developer choice and flexibility with operational control. For this solution, it utilizes the connectors for HL7 and FHIR messaging standards, interoperates in/out of clinic systems, connects to third-party data sources, and establishes and manages APIs and connectors to clinical and financial entities. Real-time data and events are securely integrated and streamed between systems. Red Hat Application Foundations also acts as a high throughput receiver for edge signals and events.

== Architectures

=== iDaaS overview

Figure 3 shows a schematic overview of the overall IDaaS solution.

_Figure 3. Schematic overview look at iDaaS, providing the solution details in both a network and data centric view._

All requests enter through the API management element, used to secure and authenticate access to internal services and applications. The first collection of elements is iDaaS Connect where the integration services for specific communication channels are located. The individual integration service elements handle both the message standards and transformation needed between systems and those standards.

The iDaaS Connect services register events and receive event notifications from the iDaaS Connect events. This is the central hub that ensures all events undergo registration, management, and that notifications are sent when needed to the appropriate elements in the iDaaS architecture.

Events will often trigger elements of the iDaaS DREAM collection through the iDaaS event builder (which captures business automation activities) and the iDaaS intelligent data router. The data router can manage where specific data needs to be sent, both inbound to sources and outbound to application or service destinations. It’s assisted by the iDaaS connect data distribution element which ensures integration with the many data sources which might be in local or remote locations such as a public cloud.

The iDaaS architecture provides both conformance and insights into the knowledge being managed by the offered solutions. The iDaaS knowledge insight element manages analytics and insights into the data available across the live platform. This can provide near-real time gathering and reporting as organizational needs require.

The iDaaS knowledge conformance element is a set of applications and tools that allow for any organization to automate compliance and regulation adherence using rule systems customized to their own local needs.


=== iDaaS connect for HL7 FHIR

Figure 4 provides An example of integration through iDaaS Connect features around HL7 and FHIR healthcare messaging standards.

(The iDaaS knowledge and insight elements were left out of this schematic to reduce diagram complexity. They return in the section below.)

The rest of Figure 4 remains the same as the previous section with one exception: the iDaaS Connect collection is now focusing only on the elements for integrating HL7 and FHIR protocols.

There are two elements featuring microservice collections designed to provide messaging between incoming HL7 and FHIR messages and the rest of the systems. Message transformation microservices are needed to ensure integration with its destination. These transformations happen incoming to the event system and outgoing before delivering back to the originating source.



=== iDaaS knowledge and insight

The focus of Figure 5 is to clarify how knowledge and insight are used to provide for near real-time understanding of the data across the organization.

_Figure 5. The focus of this schematic is to clarify how knowledge and insight are used to provide for near real-time understanding of the data across the organization._

(To simplify the diagram, the iDaaS Connect collection has been reduced down to just a single integration and transformation story using FHIR messages.)

The rest of this diagram remains the same as Figure 3 with the focus and expansion of the knowledge and insight elements where we turn to now.

The iDaaS knowledge insight element plugs into the processes and decisions being taken centrally in the iDaaS DREAM collection. This ensures a near-real time view of all events-driven data processing through the organization.

In the iDaaS knowledge conformance element, one finds the insights exposed for an organization’s review / reporting of their data compliance needs. It also shows the access given to an organization’s compliance officer for monitoring and reporting.
