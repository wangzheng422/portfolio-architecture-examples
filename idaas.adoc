Our world  transformed overnight, and healthcare had to respond immediately. Now more than ever, it's critical to have access to data and unlimited scale, and to design and modify decisioning, processes, and workflows for specific
situations without being vendor-dependent. The solution presented here covers the use case around using intelligent data as a service in the healthcare industry. https://www.redhat.com/en/solutions/healthcare[Red Hat] is here to help
with a flexible, open approach.

====
*Intelligent Data as a Service*
. Getting access to data from our disparate systems
. Finding better ways to take action based on real-time data
. Focus on data where it lives for reusability, scalability and extensibility
====

*Use case:* Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) is about building and delivery of systems and platforms in a secure
and scalable manner while driving data needs for moving towards consumerization in healthcare.

--

The following technology was chosen for this solution:

====
https://www.redhat.com/en/products/integration?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Integration*] utilizes the connectors for HL7 and FHIR, interoperate in/out of clinic systems, and connect to
third-party data sources. Establish and manage API and connectors to clinical and financial entities. Integrate and
streams real-time data and events securely between systems. Also provide high throughput receiver for  edge signal and
events.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations*] software-defined storage for health records, images, events and knowledge base
repositories. Easily scale across data-center and clouds.

https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift Runtimes*] simplifies continuous delivery of applications with frameworks such as Spring Boot and
Quarkus. Full stack kubernetes-native Java framework for microservices and native compilation.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat OpenShift*] is the base platform for iDaaS, an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container orchestration and management
platform. It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux?intcmp=7013a00000318EWAAY[*Red Hat Enterprise Linux*] is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

== iDaaS overview

--

This is an overview look at iDaaS, providing the solution details and the elements described above in both a network
and data centric view:

All requests enter through the API management element, used to secure and authenticate access to internal services and applications. The first collection of elements is iDaaS Connect where the integration services for specific communication channels are located. The individual integration service elements handle both the message standards and transformation needed between systems and those standards.

The iDaaS Connect services register events and receive event notification from the iDaaS connect events. This is a central hub that ensures all events undergo registration, management, and notifications are sent when needed to the appropriate elements in the iDaaS architecture.

Events will often trigger elements of the iDaaS DREAM collection through the iDaaS event builder which captures business automation activities and the iDaaS intelligent data router. The data router can manage where specific data needs to be sent, both inbound to sources and outbound to application or service destinations. It's assisted by the iDaaS connect data distribution element which ensures integration with many data sources which might be in local or remote locations such as a public cloud.

The iDaaS architecture provides both conformance and insights into the knowledge being managed by the offered solutions. The iDaaS knowledge insight element manages analytics and insights into the data available across the live platform. This can  provide near-realtime gathering and reporting as organizational needs require. 

The iDaaS knowledge conformance element is a set of applications and tools that allow for any organization to automate compliancy and regulation adherence using rule systems customized to their own local needs.

== iDaaS connect for HL7 FHIR

In this schematic the details are exposed as to an examaple of integration through iDaaS Connect features around HL7
and FHIR healthcare messaging standards:

First, the iDaaS knowledge and insight elements were left out of this schematic to reduce diagram complexity. They
return in the section below.

The rest of this diagram remains the same as the previous section with one exception, the iDaaS Connect collection
is now focusing only on the elements for integrating HL7 and FHIR protocols.

There are two elements featuring microservice collections designed to provide messaging between incoming HL7 and FHIR
messages to the rest of the systems. Message transformation microservices are needed to ensure integration with its
destination. These transformations happen incoming to the event system and outgoing before delivering back to the
originating source.


== iDaaS knowledge and insight
--

--

The focus of this schematic is to clarify how knowledge and insight are used to provide for near real-time understanding of the data across the organization:

First, note that the iDaaS Connect collection has been reduced down to just a single integration and transformation story using FHIR messages to simplify the diagrams.

The rest of this diagram remains the same as the first section with the focus and expansion of the knowledge and
insight elements where we turn to now.

The iDaaS knowledge insight element plugs into the processes and decisions being taken centrally in the iDaaS Dream collection. This ensures a near real-time view can be on all events driven data processing through the organization.

In the iDaaS knowledge conformance element, one finds the insights exposed for an organization's review / reporting of their data compliance needs. It also shows the access given to an organization's compliance officer for monitoring and reporting.
