This architecture covers the use case around using intelligent data as a service (iDaaS) in the healthcare industry.
Our world  transformed overnight, and healthcare had to respond immediately. Now more than ever, it's critical to have
access to data and unlimited scale, and to design and modify decisioning, processes, and workflows for specific
situations without being vendor-dependent. https://www.redhat.com/en/solutions/healthcare[Red Hat] is here to help
with a flexible, open approach.

*Use case:* Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) is about building and delivery of systems and platforms in a secure
and scalable manner while driving data needs for moving towards consumerisation in healthcare.

== The technology

* The following technology was chosen for this solution:

** *Red Hat Integration* utilize the connectors for HL7 and FHIR, interoperate in/out of clinic systems, and connect to
third-party data sources. Establish and manage API and connectors to clinical and financial entities. Integrate and
streams real-time data and events securely between systems. Also provide high throughput receiver for  edge signal and
events.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundations* software-defined storage for health records, images, events and knowledge base
repositories. Easily scale across data-center and clouds.

** *Red Hat OpenShift Runtimes* simplify continuous delivery of applications with frameworks such as Spring Boot and
Quarkus. Full stack kubernetes-native Java framework for microservices and native compilation.

** *Red Hat OpenShift* base platform for iDaaS, an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container orchestration and management
platform. It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments.

** *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform. It’s an open source operating system
(OS). It’s the foundation from which you can scale existing apps—and roll out emerging technologies—across bare-metal,
virtual, container, and all types of cloud environments.

* This is an overview look at iDaaS, providing the solution details and the elements described above in both a network
and data centric view:

** *HL7 FHIR:* FHIR is a standard for health care data exchange, published by HL7.

** *Third-party data providers:* noSQL, devices, edge devices, backend systems, SQL, Cloudera, Apache Kafka

** *iDaaS Connect Clinical:* connector for clinical industry standards.

** *iDaaS Connect Financial:* connector for financial industry standards.

** *iDaaS Connect Third-party:* connectory for industry third-party data sources and event streams.

** *iDaaS Event Builder:* used with industry and business models

** *Clinical data tagging:* data tagged with relevant clinical information, enriching data.

** *aiDoc:* Assigned Insights for Disease, Outbreaks, and Conditions.

** *Terminology mediation:* terminology mediation and cross mapping, data transformation.

** *iDaaS Intelligent Data Router:* specific data routing with AI/ML decision logic foundations.

** *ER real-time wait detector & remediation:* component to manage emergency room waiting times.

** *Dynamic data transformation:* data transformation components.

** *iDaaS UI:* user interface for users and administrators.

** *iDaaS API:* management for API landscape.

** *iDaaS Data Hub:* the AI/ML aspects for use in data solutions.


== iDaaS connect for HL7 FHIR

* In this schematic the details are exposed as to an exmaple of integration through iDaaS Connect features around HL7
and FHIR healthcare messaging standards:

** First, the iDaaS knowledge and insight elements were left out of this schematic to reduce diagram complexity. They
return in the section below.

** The rest of this diagram remains the same as the previous section with one exception, the iDaaS Connect collection
is now focusing only on the elements for integrating HL7 and FHIR protocols.

** There are two elements featuring microservice collections designed to provide messaging between incoming HL7 and FHIR
messages to the rest of the systems. Message transformation microservices are needed to ensure integration with its
destination. These transformations happen incoming to the event system and outgoing before delivering back to the
originating source.


== iDaaS knowledge and insight

* The focus of this schematic is to clarify how knowledge and insight are used to provide for near real-time
understanding of the data across the organisation:

** First note that the iDaaS Connect collection has been reduced down to just a single integration and transformation
story using FHIR messages to simplify the diagrams.

** The rest of this diagram remains the same as the first section with the focus and expansion of the knowledge and
insight elements where we turn to now.

** The iDaaS knowledge insight element plugs into the processes and decision being taken centrally in the iDaaS Dream
collection. This ensures a near real-time view can be given on all events driven data processing through the
organisation.

** In the iDaaS knowledge conformance element one finds the insights exposed for an organisations review / reporting
around their data compliance needs. It also shows the access given to an organisation's compliance officer for
monitoring and reporting.
