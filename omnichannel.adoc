_Some details will differ based on the requirements of a specific implementation but all portfolio architectures generalize one or more successful deployments of a use case._


== Use case 
Omnichannel implies integration and orchestration of channels such that the experience of engaging across all the channels someone chooses to use.

== Background
In today's competitive marketplace, it is more important than ever to deliver an omnichannel customer experience that lets customers interact in a unified way across platforms. By doing so, you can improve customer satisfaction, reduce customer churn, and enhance your brand reputation.

Let’s consider these inter-related benefits in more detail:

*Increased customer satisfaction:* Customers expect to be able to interact with businesses on their terms, using the channels that they prefer. By delivering an omnichannel experience, you can meet these expectations and improve customer satisfaction.

*Reduced customer churn:* When customers have a positive experience with your business, they are more likely to do business with you again in the future. Delivering an omnichannel experience can help to reduce customer churn and increase customer loyalty—resulting in increased sales over time. And reducing customer acquisition costs given that the cost of acquiring a new customer is much higher than the cost of retaining an existing customer.

*Enhanced brand reputation:* A positive customer experience can help to enhance your brand reputation and attract new customers. By delivering an omnichannel experience, you can build a strong brand that customers trust and value.

A variety of largely non-technical steps go into designing a good omnichannel customer experience. For example, such a design rests first and foremost on understanding your customers and their needs. What channels do they prefer to use? What are their expectations for customer service? Only once you understand your customers, can uou start to design an experience that meets their needs.

Next, you need to identify the channels that you will use to interact with them. This could include your website, mobile app, social media, email, phone, chat, and even in-person channels.Customers also want to feel like they are being treated as individuals, so it's important to personalize your experiences as much as possible. This means using their data to understand their preferences and deliver relevant content and offers.

It will be an ongoing and iterative process. It's important to measure the results of your omnichannel customer experience so that you can see what's working and what's not. This will help you to improve your experience over time.

From the perspective of the solution presented in this portfolio architecture, however, connecting channels and connecting data so that customers can easily move from one channel to another is also a critical element. 


== Solution overview

Red Hat provides a foundation for IT teams to develop and deliver omnichannel services through a combination of integration and process automation technologies. Agile integration defines how organizations are transforming and delivering on their digital promise to customers by integrating applications and services across on-premise infrastructure and cloud environments. Business automation, as process integrations, are captured to enable access to complex process services.

As shown in Figure 1, the omnichannel customer experience solution includes:
* Data management, security, and user access
* Multiple protocol support through different integration technologies
* Distributed deployments with non-centralized integration

== Logical diagram

Figure 2 shows a logical view of the omnichannel customer experience solution. There are four primary areas of interest:

* The container platform which includes applications and process/data microservices
* Gateways and proxies including API management
* External mobile and web applications
* The shared storage services

== Architectures

The schematic diagrams in Figures 3 through 7 provide deeper looks at various aspects of the omnichannel customer experience solution. For clarity, common components such as monitoring are not shown.



=== Process integration example

--

_Figure 3: Schematic diagram of process integration in the omnichannel customer experience solution_


Figure 3 shows the example of a mobile application making calls through the API Gateway to interact with both front-end microservices and process microservices running in the container platform. Integration microservices provide access to the back-end systems.. Container Native Storage is used for process storage as an example. Monitoring components are not shown.



=== Mobile integration example

--

_Figure 4: Schematic diagram of mobile integration in the omnichannel customer experience solution_

In Figure 4, a mobile application likewise makes calls through the API Gateway. Here, it’s to interface both front-end microservices and mobile services to serve data to the device while integrating with back-end systems through the integration microservices. Container Native Storage is shown as the data source for mobile data consumption in this example for simplicity.


=== Integration service example

--

_Figure 5: Schematic diagram of integration service in the omnichannel customer experience solution_

Figure 5 shows the example use of integration microservices with a web user interface making calls through the API Gateway to front-end microservices that, in turn, call to various integration with back-end systems through an integration microservice. In this example, the SSO server integrates with an existing company back-end Active Directory server for authentication. 

=== Integration data service example
--

--

_Figure 6: Schematic diagram of integration data service in the omnichannel customer experience solution_

This example is similar to the integration service example shown in Figure 5. In this case, the integration is with a customer contact database through an integration data microservice. As in the prior example, the SSO server integrates with an existing company back-end Active Directory server for authentication. 

=== Integration third-party services

_Figure 7: Schematic diagram of integrating third-party services in the omnichannel customer experience solution_

Figure 7 again shows integration between a client application and services outside the container platform. In this example, those services are from a third-party—in this case a bank.
