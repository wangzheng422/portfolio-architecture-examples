== Overview
This repository provides examples of customer researched based general architectures based on usage of the Red Hat
product portfolio. The architectures detail three different levels of detail starting with *Logical* diagrams, then
a more in-depth view of how the solution works in *Schematic* diagrams, and finally by diving in for a closer look 
with  *Detailed* diagrams.
