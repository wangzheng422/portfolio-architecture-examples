== Overview
This repository provides examples of customer researched based general architectures based on usage of the Red Hat
product portfolio. All architectural diagrams are created using the open source tool draw.io. The examples provide for
*Logical* diagrams, more in-depth view of how the solution works in *Schematic* diagrams and closer looks at
elements in *Detailed* diagrams.
